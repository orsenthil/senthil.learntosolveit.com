<p>Enjoyed reading "The Martian Way" story by Asimov. Takes place in a future setting where there are dwellers in mars,
and Earth has decided to ration the supply of water to mars. Martians get worried, but a group, adventurous enough,
decide to get the water from "elsewhere" in the galaxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still thinking like an earthling?</p>
<p>Get out of your rut, open your mind—there’s a whole universe waiting. It’s waiting for people who aren’t afraid of thinking in new ways, of doing new things.</p>
<p>Can you imagine…</p>
<p>…mining the skies for water?</p>
<p>…building a new world beneath the surface of a strange planet?</p>
<p>…making pets out of alien explorers?</p>
<p>…putting your life in the hands of a teen-aged computer?</p>
<p>If you can, you’re well on your way to becoming a member of the space generation—you’re thinking The Martian Way.</p>

<p>There is a wired story which predicted that advancements in artificial intelligence will result
in programs getting trained rather than being written. This is keeping in line with machine learning
advancements popular these days where the number of people who are doing "machine learning"
need not learn "how to write the machine learning algorithms", instead they just need to learn
"how to use machine learning algorithms" on data. They should be efficient at using "algorithms".</p>
<p>That was total alien concept to me until I saw a whole category and industry flourish with that concept. Given
the background, the wired articles prediction was that programs will be trained instead of being written.</p>
<p>I found an alternate argument, from a credible and respectable source <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code By: Robert C. Martin</a>
It goes like this.</p>
<p><strong>There Will Be Code</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times—that code is no longer the issue;
that we should be concerned about models and requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that
we are close to the end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That
programmers simply won’t be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications.</p>
<p>Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At
some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying
requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.</p>
<p>I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages will continue to increase. I also expect that the number
of domain-specific languages will continue to grow. This will be a good thing. But it will not eliminate code.
Indeed, all the specifications written in these higher level and domain-specific language will be code! It will
still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute it.</p>
<p>The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who hope one day to discover a
mathematics that does not have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create machines
that can do what we want rather than what we say. These machines will have to be able to understand us so well
that they can translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs.</p>
<p>This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity, have been able to create successful
systems from the vague feelings of their customers. Indeed, if the discipline of requirements specification has taught
us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!</p>
<p>Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create
languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those
requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.</p>

"An equation for me has no meaning, unless it represents a thought of God." - Srinivasa Ramanujan</blockquote>
<p>"The man who knew infinity" is the story of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a>. This phrase, associated with Ramanujan should be
familiar to many due to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/B00C7F17OE/">very popular book</a> with the same title. There is a motion picture directed by Matt Brown
based upon this book.</p>
<p>I watched his movie on a Saturday at Berkeley. I was excited to listen to the QA with the director, and Mathematicians
such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borcherds">Richard Borcheds</a> , <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~oholtz/">Olga Holz</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/">Ken Ribet</a> following the screening.</p>
<p>In India, we have been exposed to Ramanujan quite early in our lives. I had stories in school book about great Indian
mathematicians like Aryabhata, Brahmangupta, and Bhaskaracharya. Indian Satellites to Space launched by ISRO bear their
names too. Along with those personalities, we have Srinivasa Ramanujan and whom we know for his invention of <a class="reference external" href="https://nrich.maths.org/1380">Magic
Squares</a>, and <strong>Ramanujan Number</strong>, <strong>the smallest number expressible as sum of two cubes.</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
1729 = 1^3 + {12}^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Beyond that, I had not known much about the significance of this number or Ramanujan's work.</p>
<p>Years later, when taking <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/h_9WjWENWV8?t=14m48s">online courses</a>, I had come to know about Hardy and Ramanujan's research in Number Theory
being at the core of secure communication and cryptography. Do you use Credit Cards online and feel confident that
someone will not maliciously take your money? All this is was because of the research in number theory.</p>
<p>There is also famous anecdote associated with Ramanujan, known to many from South India, Ramanujan prayed to a goddess,
and she gave inspiration for his work.  He mentions that his theorems had come up like a dream, a boon granted by the
Goddess, and he would write formulae in his book. That's how he invented those theorems.</p>
<p>If it happened like that, imagine how excited young students from Madurai will
be, where there a temple every hundred feet. :) It needs to be clarified that,
Ramanujan was a genius and he also worked very hard on his subjects.</p>
<p>A better understanding of this phenonmemon, in general, is now known. The style of discovery is called
" <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbRc8uUKSHM">diffused mode</a> learning", wherein after an intense work on challenging
problem, the solution suddenly comes up during a restful time.</p>
<p>All these are portrayed well in this movie. The relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan, the scientific culture at
Trinity College, London revealed in real detail. The movie has a significant portion dealing with how Hardy mentors
Ramanujan, and strives to bring his work to the modern world.</p>
<p>In the question and answer session that followed, two questions were of interest to me.</p>
<p><strong>How do mathematicians study Ramanujan's work when he has not left many formula proofs with his equation?</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borcherds">Richard Borcheds</a>, who is an accomplished mathematician, replied that Ramanujan's work was published in the form of
series of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ramanujans-Notebooks-Bruce-C-Berndt/dp/1461270073/">notebooks</a>. He left behind three notebooks containing almost 3000 theorems, virtually all without proof. The
reason he could have done that is perhaps he grew up in a time when the paper was very expensive for him and he wanted
to be economical.</p>
<p>(It did not answer the question, but provided a good perspective).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: In the movie, Ramanujan is shown to be desisting writing formal proofs. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p>Richard Borcheds shared that, it is bit exaggerated in the movie. Ramanujan always knew the proof of his work and
could state it if he wanted to. But he usually did not.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching this movie and listening to the perspectives associated with the genius from kumbakonam.</p>

<p>Oxford Comma is the final comma in the list of things mentioned in a sentence. In this statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">I like computer science, maths, and programming.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>The comma after the word maths and before the conjunction, and, is considered the Oxford comma. Other commonly used
terms that refer to this style are the serial comma, a series comma, or a Harvard comma.</p>
<p>In my writing, before this essay, I had never added a comma on the final element of the conjunction. This topic piqued
my interest, and I started doing research on this entity.</p>
<p>The term, Oxford comma, got its name from the Oxford University Press style guide. It was recommended by the Oxford
style guide even when many British journals and publications were not recommending it. My first conscious encounter with
it was during the diagnostic test. I was not able to correct the sentence by placing a serial comma. I had never
considered a statement, with a list of items, wrong if it did not have a serial comma. We always try to infer the
meaning from the context. But in fact, as will see shortly, it may not be possible at all times and the reason to
include Oxford comma is to reduce ambiguity in the sentence.</p>
<p>The reason we do not notice the lack Oxford comma is, the Associated Press style guide, which many newspapers follow,
does not require us to use Oxford comma, and thus, it is often left out. Let's notice an ambiguity when we lack the
Oxford comma.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia and Steve Jobs.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an ambiguity about the writer's parentage here because Alicia and Steve Jobs can be read as in apposition to
his parents, leading the reader to believe that writer claims Alicia and Steve Jobs are his parents. Whereas,  placing
the Oxford comma after Alicia will resolve the ambiguity.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia, and Steve Jobs.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>It articulates clearly that the writer is referring to 3 separate entities in his dedication. There are cases when
inclusion of Oxford comma can make a sentence ambiguous too. For example, this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my father, Steve Jobs, and Alicia.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>The serial comma after my father creates ambiguity about the writer's father because it uses punctuation identical to
that utilized for an appositive phrase, suggesting that Steve Jobs is the writer's father. It is unclear whether there
are three people (1. my father; 2. Steve jobs; and 3. Alicia) or it is only two (1. Steve Jobs and 2. Alicia. Steve Jobs
is writer's father). The common way to disambiguate this sentence is to refer to each entity as a noun. For e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my father, to Steve Jobs, and Alicia.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the placement of the comma can significantly affect the meaning of the entire sentence. By appropriately choosing
words and with always using Oxford comma, we can write less ambiguous phrases. Also, Oxford comma matches with the
spoken cadence of sentences better.</p>
<p>If you need only one reference to remember this concept, then keep this picture in your mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Siddhartha, "I make one-off changes to Simulations on Earth."</p>
<p>Govind adjusted his glasses and wondered. "Really?."</p>
<p>"I mean it. I make real people come to readings and discussions of their stories."</p>
<p>"And?".</p>
<p>"The characters themselves evaluate how they are understood. I introduced Asimov into a class which was doing a
discussion of his short story 'The Immortal Bard'."</p>
<p>"Oh wow, exciting."</p>
<p>"Asimov was excited too since it was his favorite subject. But, then."</p>
<p>"Hmm.?"</p>
<p>"He quickly became dismayed. His original writing of Immortal Bard was to illustrate, given enough time, how experts of
this world create their meaning of original sources. When creators themselves come to face them, they so much believe in
their interpretation and revisions that they fail the creator himself."</p>
<p>"That's what happened to Shakespeare in that story. Yeah, I know, that was a hilarious one. "</p>
<p>"Right, but what Asimov found was, the discussion was not about what he felt the readers might enjoy from his story.
Instead, everyone went on to prove, why the immortal bard will fail when he brings him back."</p>
<p>"Amusing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, Asimov pondered, how the story could be perceived and readers change the intention when asked to prove something
in an assignment. The Good Doctor that he was, continued with his writing, thinking that someday readers will be able to
enjoy his stories as he meant it, perhaps with the help of an artificially intelligent agent."</p>

<p>Our universe is complex and our knowledge of it is limited. It is very hard to keep track of various breakthroughs and
connect the dots. Moreover, as we focus on narrow pursuits, we often tend to lose our path in fundamental sciences. We
become five-year-olds in fundamental sciences. Reddit's "Explain like I am Five" is one of the first things I look for
whenever the world comes across a major scientific breakthrough.</p>
<p>When the existence of <a class="reference external" href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102">gravitational waves</a> was proven on Feb 11, 2016, the question on everyone's mind was "what are
gravitational waves", "why is it a big deal?", "Should I even care?". Well, honestly, many of us and our children can
live for 100s of years without caring, but generations beyond those, assuming humanity survives, will find Feb 11 2016,
discovery to be useful. Such breakthroughs are not new, just a few hundred years ago, we did not believe that <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/earth-is-spherical.html">earth was
spherical</a>.</p>
<p>So, what are gravitational waves?</p>
<p>When you consider the <a class="reference external" href="https://einstein.stanford.edu/content/relativity/a11332.html">space as matter</a>, and when bodies like stars and sun move that matter, they produce waves on
that surface. Using instruments it is confirmed that these waves exists and we actually "listened" to them for real!</p>
<p>To follow along in simple terms, this is the excerpt of the conversation on Reddit.</p>
<p>A user <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/loljetfuel">loljetfuel</a> explained the concept like.</p>
<blockquote>
Since I actually tried to explain this to a pair of 5-year-olds today, I figure why not share :) You know how when you
throw a rock in a pool, there are ripples? And how if we throw bigger rocks in, they make bigger ripples? Well, a long
time ago, a really smart guy named Einstein said that stars and planets and stuff should make ripples in space, and he
used some really cool math to explain why he thought that. Lots of people checked the math and agree that he was right.
But we've never been able to see those ripples before. Now some people built a really sensitive measuring thing that
uses lasers to see them, and they just proved that their device works by seeing ripples from a really big splash. So now
we know how to see them and we can get better at it, which will help us learn more about space.</blockquote>
<p>The scientist from LIGO, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dwarfboy1717">dwarfboy1717</a> further supported this answer stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>LIGO scientist here! Great explanation! I'll add:</p>
<p>If Einstein is right (hint: HE IS), gravitational waves would travel outward from (for instance) two black holes
circling each other just like the ripples in a pond. When they come to Earth and pass through the detectors, a signal
can tell us not only that the gravitational wave has been found, but it can also tell us lots of information about the
gravitational wave! As you track what the gravitational waves look like over a (very) short amount of time, you can tell
what kind of event caused them, like if it was two black holes colliding or a violent supernova... along with other
details, like what the mass of these stars/black holes would have been! This discovery has ushered in an awesome new era
of astronomy. BEFORE we started detecting gravitational waves, looking out at the universe was like watching an
orchestra without any sound! As our detectors start making regular observations of this stuff, it will be like turning
on our ears to the symphony of the cosmos!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Big Deal!. It's wonderful we are able to share this news in a way that every one of us can understand and relate to!</p>

<p>We awe at Donald Knuth. I wondered, if I can understand a subject taught by Knuth and derive satisfaction of learning
something directly from the master. I attended his most recent lecture on "comma free codes", felt that it was
accessible and could be understood by putting some effort. This is my attempt to grasp the topic of "comma free codes",
taught by Knuth for his 21st annual christmas tree lecture on Dec 2015. We will use some definitions directly from
Williard Eastman's paper, reference the topics in wikipedia, look at Knuth's explanation.</p>
<p>We talk of codes in the context of information theory. A code is a system of rules to convert information—such as a
letter, word, sound, image, or gesture—into another form or representation. A sequence of symbols, like a sequence of
binary symbols, sequence of base-10 decimals or a sequence of English language alphabets can all be termed as "code". A
block code is a set of codes having the same length.</p>
<p><strong>Comma Free Block Code</strong></p>
<p>Comma free code is a code that can be easily synchronized without any external unit like comma or space,
"<strong>likethis</strong>". Comma free block code is set of same length codes having the comma free property.</p>
<p>The four letter words in "<strong>goodgame</strong>" is recognizable, it easy to derive those as "<strong>good</strong>" and "<strong>game</strong>".
Other possible substring four letter words in that phrase "<strong>oodg</strong>", "<strong>odga</strong>", "<strong>dgga</strong>" are invalid words in
english (or non code-words) and thus we did not have any problem separating the codewords when they were not
separated by delimiters like space or comma. Anecdotally, Chinese and Thai languages do not use space between words.</p>
<p>Take an alternate example, "<strong>fujiverb</strong>". Can you say deterministically if the word "<strong>jive</strong>" is my code word? Or my
code words consists only of "<strong>fuji</strong>" and "<strong>verb</strong>". You cannot determine it from this message and thus, "fuji" and
"verb" do not form valid a "comma free block codes".</p>
<p>The same applies to a periodic code word like "<strong>gaga</strong>". If a message "<strong>gagagaga</strong>" occurs, then the middle word
"<strong>gaga</strong>" will be ambiguous as it is composed of 2-letter suffix and a 2-prefix of our code word and we wont be able to
differentiate it.</p>
<p><strong>Mathematical definition</strong></p>
<p>Comma free code words are defined like this.</p>
<blockquote>
A block code, <strong>C</strong> containing words of length <strong>n</strong> is called comma free if, and only if, for any words
<span class="math">\(w = w_1, w_2 ... w_n. \: and \: x = x_1, x_2 ... x_n\)</span> belonging to <strong>C</strong>, the <strong>n</strong> letter overlaps
<span class="math">\(w_k ... w_nx_1 .... x_{k-1} (k = 2, ... n)\)</span> are not words in the code.</blockquote>
<p>This simply means that if two code words are joined together, than in that joined word, any substring from second letter
to the last of the block code length should not be a code word.</p>
<p><strong>How to find them?</strong></p>
<p>Backtracking.</p>
<p>The general idea to find comma free block codes is use a backtracking solution and for every word that we want to add to
the list, prune through through already added words and find if the new word can be a substring of two words joined
together from the existing list. Knuth gave a demo of finding the maximum comma free subset of the four letter words.</p>

<p>This logic is dependent on the order in which comma free block codes are analyzed. For finding a maximal set in a given
alphabet size in any order a proper backtracking based solution should be devised, which considers all the cases of
insertions.</p>
<p><strong>How many are there?</strong></p>
<p>Backtracking based solution requires us to intelligently prune the search space. Finding effective strategies for
pruning the search space becomes our the next problem in finding the comma free codes. We will have to determine how
many comma free block codes are possible for a given alphabet size and for a given length.</p>
<p>For 4 letter words, (n = 4) of the alphabet size <strong>m</strong>, we know that there are <span class="math">\(m^4\)</span> possible words (permutation
with repetition). But we're restricted to aperiodic words of length 4, of which there are <span class="math">\(m^4 - m^2\)</span>. Notice
further that if word, <strong>item</strong> has been chosen, we aren't allowed to include any of its cyclic shifts <strong>temi</strong>, <em>emit*</em>,
or <strong>mite</strong>, because they all appear within <strong>itemitem</strong>. Hence the maximum number of codewords in our commafree code
cannot exceed <span class="math">\((m^4 - m^2)/4\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us consider the binary case, m = 2 and length n = 4, <strong>C(2, 4)</strong>. We can choose four-bit "words" like this.</p>
<p>[0001] = {0001, 0010, 0100, 1000},</p>
<p>[0011] = {0011, 0110, 1100, 1001},</p>
<p>[0111] = {0111, 1100, 1101, 1011},</p>
<p>The maximum number of code words from our formula will be <span class="math">\(2^4 - 2^2/4 \: = \: 3\)</span>.  Can we choose three
four-bit "words" from the above cyclic classes? Yes and choosing the lowest in each cyclic class will simply do. But
choosing the lowest will not work for all n and m.</p>
<p>In the class taught by Knuth, we analyzed the choosing codes when m = 3 {0, 1, 2} and for n = 3, <strong>C(3, 3)</strong>. The words
in the category were</p>
<p>000  111  222     # Invalid since they are periodic</p>
<p>001  010  100     # A set of cyclic shifts, only one can taken as a valid code word.</p>
<p>002  020  200</p>
<p>011  110  101</p>
<p>012  120  201</p>
<p>021  210  102</p>
<p>112  121  211</p>
<p>220  202  022</p>
<p>221  212  122</p>
<p>The number 3-alphabet code words of length 3 is 27 ( = <span class="math">\(3^3\)</span>). The set of valid code words in this will be
<span class="math">\((3^3-3) / 3 = 8\)</span>.</p>
<p>Choosing the lowest index will not work here for e.g, if we choose 021 and 220, and we send the word 220021 the word 002
is conflicting as it is part of our code word. With any back-tracking based solution, we will have to determine the
correct non-cyclic words to choose in each set to form our maximal set of 8 code words.</p>
<p>The problem of finding comma free code words increases exponentially to the size of the length of the code word and on
the code word size. For e.g, The task of finding all four-letter comma free codes is not difficult when m = 3, and only
18 cycle classes are involved. But it already becomes challenging when m = 4, because we must then deal with <span class="math">\((4^4
- 4^2) / 4 = 60\)</span> classes. Therefore we'll want to give it some careful thought as we try to set it up for backtracking.</p>
<p>Willard Eastman came up with clever solution to find a code word for any odd word length n over an infinite alphabet
size. Eastman proposed a solution wherein if we give a n letter word (n should be odd), the algorithm will output the
correct shift required to make the n letter word a code word.</p>
<p><strong>Eastman's Algorithm</strong></p>
<p><strong>Construction of Comma Free Codes</strong></p>
<p>The following elegant construction yields a comma free code of maximum size for any odd block length n, over any
alphabet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a sequence of <span class="math">\(x =x_0x_1...x_{n-1}\)</span> of nonnegative integers, where x differs from each of its
other cyclic shifts <span class="math">\(x_k...x_{n-1}x_0..x_{k-1}\)</span> for 0 &lt; k &lt; n, the procedure outputs a cyclic shift
<span class="math">\(\sigma x\)</span> with the property that the set of all such <span class="math">\(\sigma x\)</span> is a commafree.</p>
<p>We regard x as an infinite periodic sequence <span class="math">\(&lt;x_n&gt;\)</span> with <span class="math">\(x_k = x_{k-n}\)</span> for all <span class="math">\(k \ge n\)</span>. Each
cyclic shift then has the form <span class="math">\(x_kx_{k+1}...x_{k+n-1}\)</span>. The simplest nontrivial example occurs when n = 3,
where <span class="math">\(x=x_0 x_1 x_2 x_0 x_1 x_2 x_0 ...\)</span> and we don't have <span class="math">\(x_0 = x_1 = x_2\)</span>. In this case, the algorithm
outputs <span class="math">\(x_kx_{k+1}x_{k+2}\)</span> where <span class="math">\(x_k &gt; x_{k+1} \le x_{k+2}\)</span>; and the set of all such triples clearly
satisfies the commafree condition.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea expressed is to choose a triplet (a, b, c) of the form.</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
a \: \gt b \: \le c
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p><strong>Why does this work?</strong></p>
<p>If we take two words, xyz and abc following this property, combining them we have,</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x \: \gt y \: \le z \quad a \: \gt b \: \le c
\end{equation*}
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li>yza cannot be a word because z cannot be &gt; than y.</li>
<li>zab cannot be a word because a cannot be &lt; than b.</li>
</ul>
<p>There by none of the substrings will be a code word and we can satisfy the comma free property.</p>
<p>And if we use this condition to determine the code words in our <strong>C(3,3)</strong> set, we will come up with the following
codes which can form valid code words.</p>
<strike>000  111  222</strike> <br>

001  010  <strong>100</strong> <br>

002  020  <strong>200</strong> <br>

011  110  <strong>101</strong> <br>

012  120  <strong>201</strong> <br>

021  210  <strong>102</strong> <br>

112  121  <strong>211</strong> <br>

220  <strong>202</strong>  022 <br>

221  <strong>212</strong>  122 <br><p>The highlighted words will form valid code words and all of these satisfy the criteria, <span class="math">\(a \: \gt b \: \le c\)</span>
Now, if you are given a word like <strong>211201212</strong>, you know for sure that they are composed of <strong>211</strong>, <strong>201</strong> and
<strong>212</strong> as none of other intermediaries like (112, 120, 201, 012, 121) occur in our set.</p>
<p>Eastman's algorithm helps in finding the correct shift required to make any word a code word.</p>
<p>For e.g,</p>
<p>Input: 001
Output: Shift by 2, thus producing 100</p>
<p>Input: 221
Output: Shift by 1, thus producing 212</p>
<p>And the beauty is, it is not just for words of length 3, but for <strong>any odd word length n</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The key idea is to think of <strong>x</strong> as partitioned into <strong>t</strong> substrings by boundary marked by <span class="math">\(b_j\)</span> where
<span class="math">\(0 \le b_0 \lt b_1 \lt ... \lt b_{t-1} &lt; n\)</span> and <span class="math">\(b_j = b_{j-t} + n\)</span> for <span class="math">\(j \ge t\)</span>. Then substring
<span class="math">\(y_j\)</span> is <span class="math">\(x_{b_j} x_{b_{j+1}-1}\)</span>. The number <strong>t</strong> of substrings is always odd. Initially, t = n and
<span class="math">\(b_j = j\)</span> for all j; ultimately t = 1 and <span class="math">\(\sigma x = y0\)</span> is the desired output.</p>
<p>Eastman's algorithm is based on comparison of adjacent substrings <span class="math">\(y_{j-1} and y_j\)</span>. If those substring have
the same length, we use lexicographic comparison; otherwise we declare that the longer string is bigger.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The number of <strong>t</strong> substring is always odd because we went with an odd string length (n).</p>
<p>The comparison of adjacent substring form the recursive nature of the algorithm, we start with small substring of
length 1 adjacent to each other and then we find compare higher length substring, whose markers have been found by
the previous step. This will become clear as we look the hand demo.</p>

<p><strong>Basin and Ranges</strong></p>
<blockquote>
It's convenient to describe the algorithm using the terminology based on the topograph of Nevada. Say that i is a
basin if the substrings satisfy <span class="math">\(y_{i-1} \gt y_i \le y_{i+1}\)</span>. There must be at least one basin; otherwise all
the <span class="math">\(y_i\)</span> would be equal, and x would equal one of its cyclic shifts. We look at consecutive basins, i and j;
this means that i &lt; j and that i and j are basins, and that i+1 through j - 1 are not basins. If there's only one
basin we have <span class="math">\(j = i + t\)</span>. The indices between consecutive basins are called ranges.</blockquote>
<p>The basin and ranges is Knuth's terminology, taken from the book Basin and Ranges by John McPhee which describes the
topology of Nevada. It is easier to imagine the construct we are looking for if we start to think in terms of basin and
ranges.</p>
<blockquote>
Since t is odd, there is an odd number of consecutive basins for which <span class="math">\(j - i\)</span> is odd. Each round of Eastman's
algorithm retains exactly one boundary point in the range between such basins and deletes all the others. The
retained point is the smallest <span class="math">\(k = i + 2l\)</span> such that <span class="math">\(y_k \gt y_{k+1}\)</span>. At the end of a round, we reset
t to the number of retained boundary points, and we begin another round if t &gt; 1.</blockquote>
<p><strong>Word of length 19</strong></p>
<p>Let's work through the algorithm by hand when n = 19 and x = 3141592653589793238</p>
<p>Phase 1</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>First markers differentiate each character.</li>
<li>We use . to denote the cyclic repetition of the 19 letter word.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
3 | 1 | 4 |  1 | 5 | 9 | 2 | 6 | 5 | 3 | 5 | 8 | 9 | 7 | 9 | 3 | 2 | 3 | 8 . 3 | 1 | 4 | 1 | 5
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Next we go about identifying basins. We identify the basins where for any 3 numbers (a, b, c), <span class="math">\(a \: \gt b
\le c\)</span> and put the markers below them</li>
<li>After the cyclic repetition we see the repetition of the basin. Like the last line below 1 is same as the first
line. It is the basin that is repeated.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
3  1  4  1  5  9  2  6  5  3  5  8  9  7  9  3  2  3  8  3  1  4  1 5

   |     |        |        |           |        |        .  |
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We mark the ranges as odd length or even length ones.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
3  1  4  1  5  9  2  6  5  3  5  8  9  7  9  3  2  3  8  3  1  4  1 5

---|--e--|---o----|---o----|-----e-----|---o----|-----e--.--|--------
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Next, take all the odd length basin markers, go by steps of 2, 4, 6 so on and identify the first greater than
number and place the new basin markers before them.</li>
</ul>
<p>For e.g, in 1-5-9-2. The 2 length path is "1-5-9" and first higher will be 9 and we have to place the marker ahead of
it. So, the phase 0 of eastman algorithm will output, 5, 8 and 15. denoting the indices where our basins are after the
first phase.</p>
<p>If you are watching the video with Knuth giving a demo, there is a mistake in the video that second basin identifier
is placed after 5, instead of before 5 (We should go by steps of 2 and place it before the first greater than number).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
3  1  4  1  5  | 9  2  6  |  5  3  5  8  9  7  9  | 3  2  3  8  . 3  1  4 1  5
</pre>
<p>Phase 2</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>In the second phase, we use the basin markers of the previous phase and compare the sub strings denoted by the basin.</li>
<li>We take the substring of length 19, but now denoted by basins. The repetition of the string in the previous steps
helped us here.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
9  2  6  |  5  3  5  8  9  7  9  | 3  2  3  8  3  1  4 1  5
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We apply the algorithm recursively on the strings 926, 5358979 and 323831415. We find that the string 323831415 is
greater than the rest, so we can keep the basin marker ahead of it.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
9  2  6  5  3  5  8  9  7  9  | 3  2  3  8  3  1  4 1  5
</pre>
<p>At the end of Phase 2, the algorithm outputs index 15, as the shift required to create the code word out of 19 word
string. And thus our code word found by the eastman's algorithm is</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
3  2  3  8  3  1  4 1  5  9  2  6  5  3  5  8  9  7  9
</pre>
<p>Knuth's gave a demo with his implementation in CWEB. He shared a thought that even though algorithm is expressed
recursively, the iterative implementation was straight forward. For the rest of the lecture he explores the
algorithm on a binary string of PI of n = 19 and finds the shift required. Also, gives the probability of Eastman's
algorithm finishing in one round, that is, just the phase 1.</p>
<p>All these are covered as exercises and answers in the pre-fascicle 5B of his volume 5 of The Art of Computer
Programming, which can be explored in further depth.</p>

<p>Had a opportunity to talk to Matz, the creator of Ruby Programming language. Some thoughts he shared were, he understood language projects as typically a very long term ones, something like 50 years. That is, if you get involved in writing a new language, the project could keep you occupied for about 50 years. He also mentioned that writing a language is easy, the subjects are taught well and books are available, but designing a good language is a hard task.</p>
<p>It was very entertaining and enriching to hear these thoughts from him.</p>

<p>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shavarsh_Karapetyan</p>
<p>Karapetyan had just completed his usual distance of 20 km (12 mi) when he heard the sound of the crash and saw the sinking trolleybus which had gone out of control and fallen from the dam wall.</p>
<p>The trolleybus lay at the bottom of the reservoir some 25 metres (80 ft) offshore at a depth of 10 metres (33 ft). Karapetyan swam to it and, despite conditions of almost zero visibility, due to the silt rising from the bottom, broke the back window with his legs. The trolleybus was crowded, it carried 92 passengers and Karapetyan knew he had little time, spending some 30 to 35 seconds for each person he saved.</p>
<p>Karapetyan managed to rescue 20 people (he picked up more, but only 20 survived), but this ended his sports career: the combined effect of cold water and the multiple wounds he received (scratched by glass), left him unconscious for 45 days. Subsequent sepsis, due to the presence of raw sewage in the lake water, and lung complications prevented him from continuing his sports career.</p>
<p>On February 19th, 1985, Shavarsh just happened to be near a burning building, that had people trapped inside. He rushed in and started pulling people out without a second thought. Once again, he was badly hurt (severe burns) and spent a long time in the hospital.</p>
<p>He later moved to Moscow and founded a shoe company called “Second Breath”. Karapetyan was later awarded a UNESCO “Fair Player” medal for his heroism.</p>

<p>The Dandi March : A simple act of making salt shakes the British Empire</p>
<p>Gandhi had some concrete plans, steps and targets while achieving his goals. He is often known for the the principles he stood for, but this is example where he followed them through, but showed a tactical approach to achieving a goal. Many find it hard to believe as how a march can be equated to a fight, but Gandhi showed that it was an act of disobedience and when done in the same spirit, it achieved the purpose of what's achieved by other means like violence.</p>
<blockquote>In early April, 1930 Gandhi, 61 years old, reached Dandi after walking 241 miles in 24 days. He then defied the law by making salt. It was a brilliant, non-violent strategy by Gandhi. To enforce the law of the land, the British had to arrest the satyagrahis (soldiers of civil disobedience) and Indians courted arrest in millions. There was panic in the administration and Indian freedom struggle  finally gathered momentum both inside and outside of India. The picture of Gandhi, firm of step and walking staff in hand (shown above) was to be among the most enduring of the images of him.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother's_Day_(U.S.)#Commercialization">Commercialization of Mother's day</a> began very early, and only nine years after the first official Mother's Day had became so rampant that Mother's Day founder Anna Jarvis herself became a major opponent of what the holiday had become, spending all her inheritance and the rest of her life fighting what she saw as an abuse of the celebration. She criticized the practice of purchasing greeting cards, which she saw as a sign of being too lazy to write a personal letter. She was arrested in 1948 for disturbing the peace while protesting against the commercialization of Mother's Day, and she finally said that she "...wished she would have never started the day because it became so out of control ..."
<p>Commercialization has ensured that the holiday has continued, when other holidays from the same time, like Children's Day and Temperance Sunday, do not now have the same level of popularity.</p>

<div class="section" id="finding-a-suitable-solution">
<h2>Finding a suitable solution</h2>
<p><em>Senthil and Avinash, Spastics Society of Karnataka.</em></p>
<p>Avinash was a student with Spastics Society of Karnataka and currently a student
with Christ University. He has multiple disabilities and suffers from Cerebral
Palsy. Senthil is a Software Developer working in Bangalore. He knows Avinash
from the time he was in Spastics Society of Karnataka and has been working him
in identifying a suitable technology for overcome his challenges in
communication.</p>
<p>Avinash and I started looking out for a suitable Assistive Technology for a long
time and we have discovered a number of things with our trial and error
methods. It was quite clear to me that Assistive Technologies will be useful for
people like Avinash.</p>
<p>Just after meeting Avinash, I realized, a software called Dasher could be useful
to him. So, I went to his house and I remember we started with Dasher. We did
not know how to use it. We read and studied the documentation and it was of no
avail. I also realized the limitations of Avinash then. I saw that he was able
to move only his thumb and the index finger and he had a lot of involuntary
movements.  We tried different kinds of mouse which he can hold on with his two
fingers and my search for an Assistive technology device started along the lines
of finding a suitable mouse device for Avinash. It was four years ago, that we
also tried Voice Recognition to see if it would be helpful. Very few people were
using Voice Recognition then and I had heard that it requires considerable
training to use the Voice Recognition. So we started with the Voice Recognition
training and we soon realized that the software was demanding a certain accent
and it was not able to recognize Avinash's style of speaking. It led us to give
up the thought on Voice Recognition itself.</p>
<div class="section" id="our-first-accessibility-device">
<h3>Our First Accessibility Device</h3>
<p>Avinash is an avid reader. I was surprised by the way he used to read his
books. He used to lie down on his side on bed and his mother used to flip pages
for him. Reducing his dependency on his Mother to flip pages for him might be
the first step forward. We knew that Adobe Acrobat reader had the auto-scroll
option that would help in reading the book.</p>
<p>In his personal laptop with books loaded as PDF documents in the auto-scroll
mode, the book will automatically scroll at regular pace set by us, Avinash
would be able to read the entire book without his mom's help. Viola! This was
our first accessibility device.</p>
<p>With this feature, he read 5 books completely. He read, "Alice in Wonderland", a
set of 14 short-stories of Sherlock Holmes and H.G.Well's "First men on Moon".</p>
<p>The Adobe Acrobat software also has a reader option where the software can read
the words aloud. However, it was not desirable as it was very mechanical and it
was not enjoyable for Avinash.</p>
<p>With the auto-scrolling feature, there still was a problem. It was not possible
for Avinash to take a break while reading as it would require manual
intervention to stop the computer from scrolling. So, Avinash had to be
constantly on his toes, so as to figuratively speak, to keep pace with the
automatic scrolling of the book.</p>
<p>We definitely needed a better solution with more control.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="second-accessibility-device-mobile-phone">
<h3>Second Accessibility Device - Mobile phone</h3>
<p>One of the mobile phones in the market had a stick like pointer in the middle
and it was very suitable for Avinash. If someone placed that mobile in his
hands, he was able to control it with the stick interface. So, we got the idea
of connecting the mobile via blue-tooth to the laptop cursor, so that the
scrolling of the book can be controlled. But the mobile which we got was
slippery and also it required its cover to be removed in order to expose the
middle stick interface properly. Buying a new mobile and tearing it down just to
use the pointer was not effective. We did try with controlling the cursor, but
it was simply inefficient given the limited control which Avinash could exercise
on his mobile phone.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="third-accessibility-device-a-very-small-infra-red-mouse">
<h3>Third Accessibility Device - A very small infra-red mouse</h3>
<p>Given that mobile phone was not suitable, I started looking out for a small
mouse which could fit into Avinash's palm. I got a Infra-red wireless mouse from
Staples store at Marathali, Bangalore. This was incidentally the first purchase,
specifically made for 'trying things out'.</p>
<p>We tried if we could control our original solution of Dasher with this
small-mouse in the way such that it could be used like a click device. We
studied Dasher again and saw that the whole operation can be controlled using a
single switch, but we did not find a way to interface that single switch to our
mouse. So, I wrote to the dasher mailing list to seek help from
experts. Dr. Julius who is an expert in assistive technology suggested that we
try out camera mouse, which can recognize Avinash's face and thus he should be
able to to control the mouse movements with his head. This was an innovative
suggestion, which we had not tried in our earlier attempts.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fourth-accessibility-device-a-camera-mouse">
<h3>Fourth Accessibility Device - A camera mouse</h3>
<p>The camera mouse solution was an interesting one. We setup the camera mouse that
it could recognize some fixed point in Avinash's face and as he moved his head
the position of the mouse pointer could be controlled.</p>
<p>And to our surprise, we found that "It worked!" We practised a lot with the
camera mouse solution, working in tandem with Dasher. These were the first few
words written by Avinash using the Camera Mouse on Dasher.</p>
<p><strong>"Education is the only possible way to enlighten the people's mind to make
this world a beaieul place to live in. "</strong></p>
<p>It is a from Dr. Kalam's book, "Inspiring thoughts". Avinash was able to write
this down with great difficulty. There is a mistake in the sentence, and I left
it consciously, because it was okay to accept mistakes in our first trials.</p>
<p>The camera mouse was not the solution yet. Due to involuntary movements, the
mouse pointer deviated frequently from the intended position. Julius suggested
to us that by gently nudging it back to the specific point this could be
controlled and he advised us to practise more. However, someone had to assist
Avinash in adjusting the camera-mouse settings properly and then load the
required software. Avinash could exhibit only a certain level of control from
this point onwards. It was a good improvement from where we started with, but it
still lacked something which we desired, namely the ease of use.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fifth-accessibility-technology-voice-recognition">
<h3>Fifth Accessibility Technology - Voice Recognition</h3>
<p>Meanwhile in the Dasher mailing list, someone had mentioned that he was using
Voice Recognition in composing the mail and he uses Voice Recognition and Dasher
simultaneously. I approached him and he suggested that Voice Recognition
technology has improved a lot in the recent years and suggested that we try with
the latest version of Microsoft Speech software.</p>
<p>This required us to upgrade the speech recognition software in the operating
system. Once we did it, we tried the Voice Recognition training program
again. To our surprise, it worked very well for Avinash's voice and his accent
was not a problem like before. We were just enthralled. We quickly finished the
training and saw if we can use the voice recognition to control the computer by
voice. However, to our disappointment, it did not recognise the correct words
when Avinash was using the software. It was due to the way the software is
designed. It had a huge sample space to search for and it did not identify what
Avinash was trying to say.</p>
<p>Then I set about to find a software which provides a limited voice recognition
capability, something like it could do only 10 tasks for the commands we
give. Given the limited and well defined set of tasks, the software may work
without any problems for Avinash.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sixth-accessibility-technology-e-speaking-voice-recognition-software">
<h3>Sixth Accessibility Technology - e-Speaking Voice Recognition software</h3>
<p>Now, we did find a software that was meeting our exact needs. It was e-Speaking
Voice Recognition software. It used the System's voice recognition engine and
provided a limited set of commands to control the computer. It was readily
available for a nominal price. We got it and found that it was exactly what we
wanted at the moment.</p>
<p>Thus, Avinash could use the software effectively using speech. He could control
the scrolling of the adobe acrobat reader to read books, browse the folder to go
and get a new book, Connect to Internet and read news etc. This was wonderful,
it enhanced his ability to work independently on his computer. With more
practise he was only getting better and this proved to be a convenient solution
for Avinash. Just switch-on the computer with with these software in the
auto-start mode, if the microphone is attached to the computer, then he could
control it from that point onwards. No manual intervention further required.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seventh-accessibility-technology-writing-via-dasher-using-speech">
<h3>Seventh Accessibility Technology - Writing via Dasher using Speech</h3>
<p>A complete solution required combining the above individual elements. Avinash
had tried and succeeded using Dasher via head-mouse and then he could now
control his computer using e-Speaking voice recognition software. How about the
idea of combining both? Namely controlling the cursor of computer via speech. We
tried and it worked again. It was immensely helpful and satisfying. Avinash was
able to write on his computer using Dasher! This required more practise in
understanding the way Dasher works. Over time, he gained the ability to control
his computer and dasher together to write sentences effectively.</p>
<p>Avinash still uses on-screen keyboard to click on letters and composing
words. He takes a long time to compose in this way. However, I believe with his
speed can be increased significantly using Dasher, which would be as close to
the average speed of one among us.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="finally-something-useful">
<h3>Finally something useful</h3>
<p>This was a very good result. We both overjoyed with the outcome. Avinash's mom
was free from the task of flipping the pages for him. Avinash was able to
immerse himself in some creative pursuit for hours together on computer and
Internet and thus be engaged with some activity or the other. Both Avinash's
father and his brother, Sanjeev are both happy with this new found capability

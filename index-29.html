<p>Police shooting of the black men were disturbing. There are videos on the internet, I suggest that you don't watch
them, it just does not help. The men were shot for <em>no-good</em> reason and if I have take an alternate stance, it is
probably because the police officer had <em>fear and hatred</em> towards the other person that he shot them.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for the police officers who shot the black men. They should be jailed for their life term for this
act.</p>
<p>Later, the protest in Dallas to condemn the shooting, some people, who carried guns, which is legal in US, shot at the
officers and killed 5 of them. This is equally brutal. In addition, police used a robot to kill the suspect too.</p>
<p>I had to recollect "Gandhi's message of peace" that many Indians have been thought since childhood. It seems to me that
folks who cite, "Second Amendment" will really not understand either Gandhi's or Christ's message to mankind.</p>

<p><em>My Rating: 4/5</em></p>
<p>There is a decent chance that you must have heard about this movie. I had heard the
name too, had a vague idea from reading synopsis what I would expect.  But I was
totally wrong. After a point, I said to myself, it is no longer good vs. evil story.</p>
<p>It has a very thin storyline but has an excellent performance
from the villain, gripping scenes that will keep you absorbed.</p>
<p>I won't the read book, but I enjoyed watching the movie.</p>

<p>I joined <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twitter.com/mesosphere">@mesosphere</a> on June 20, 2016. It's exciting as I get to work on some interesting technology in <a class="reference external" href="http://dcos.io">Datacenter
Operating System</a>. The container technology and orchestration world is in rage right now. Mesosphere is suitably
positioned in that sphere. :)</p>
<p>The most interesting thing for me will be learn the distributed systems concepts well and contributed to this space.
Plus, I discovered that our infrastructure tools are completely in Python3. Yay for that!</p>

<p>Stumbled upon this LWN.net entry written by a Linux man-pages contributor. The main point of this
article was, documenting software projects quite early on can reveal important design and code
bugs. This presented three examples of how a feature in <strong>inotify</strong> call was introduced, but was
found not working while documenting it. Similar example was given for <em>splice</em> and <em>timerfd</em> calls</p>

<p>Enjoyed reading "The Martian Way" story by Asimov. Takes place in a future setting where there are dwellers in mars,
and Earth has decided to ration the supply of water to mars. Martians get worried, but a group, adventurous enough,
decide to get the water from "elsewhere" in the galaxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still thinking like an earthling?</p>
<p>Get out of your rut, open your mind—there’s a whole universe waiting. It’s waiting for people who aren’t afraid of thinking in new ways, of doing new things.</p>
<p>Can you imagine…</p>
<p>…mining the skies for water?</p>
<p>…building a new world beneath the surface of a strange planet?</p>
<p>…making pets out of alien explorers?</p>
<p>…putting your life in the hands of a teen-aged computer?</p>
<p>If you can, you’re well on your way to becoming a member of the space generation—you’re thinking The Martian Way.</p>

<p>There is a wired story which predicted that advancements in artificial intelligence will result
in programs getting trained rather than being written. This is keeping in line with machine learning
advancements popular these days where the number of people who are doing "machine learning"
need not learn "how to write the machine learning algorithms", instead they just need to learn
"how to use machine learning algorithms" on data. They should be efficient at using "algorithms".</p>
<p>That was total alien concept to me until I saw a whole category and industry flourish with that concept. Given
the background, the wired articles prediction was that programs will be trained instead of being written.</p>
<p>I found an alternate argument, from a credible and respectable source <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882">Clean Code By: Robert C. Martin</a>
It goes like this.</p>
<p><strong>There Will Be Code</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One might argue that a book about code is somehow behind the times—that code is no longer the issue;
that we should be concerned about models and requirements instead. Indeed some have suggested that
we are close to the end of code. That soon all code will be generated instead of written. That
programmers simply won’t be needed because business people will generate programs from specifications.</p>
<p>Nonsense! We will never be rid of code, because code represents the details of the requirements. At
some level those details cannot be ignored or abstracted; they have to be specified. And specifying
requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is programming. Such a specification is code.</p>
<p>I expect that the level of abstraction of our languages will continue to increase. I also expect that the number
of domain-specific languages will continue to grow. This will be a good thing. But it will not eliminate code.
Indeed, all the specifications written in these higher level and domain-specific language will be code! It will
still need to be rigorous, accurate, and so formal and detailed that a machine can understand and execute it.</p>
<p>The folks who think that code will one day disappear are like mathematicians who hope one day to discover a
mathematics that does not have to be formal. They are hoping that one day we will discover a way to create machines
that can do what we want rather than what we say. These machines will have to be able to understand us so well
that they can translate vaguely specified needs into perfectly executing programs that precisely meet those needs.</p>
<p>This will never happen. Not even humans, with all their intuition and creativity, have been able to create successful
systems from the vague feelings of their customers. Indeed, if the discipline of requirements specification has taught
us anything, it is that well-specified requirements are as formal as code and can act as executable tests of that code!</p>
<p>Remember that code is really the language in which we ultimately express the requirements. We may create
languages that are closer to the requirements. We may create tools that help us parse and assemble those
requirements into formal structures. But we will never eliminate necessary precision—so there will always be code.</p>

"An equation for me has no meaning, unless it represents a thought of God." - Srinivasa Ramanujan</blockquote>
<p>"The man who knew infinity" is the story of <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan">Srinivasa Ramanujan</a>. This phrase, associated with Ramanujan should be
familiar to many due to a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Man-Who-Knew-Infinity-Ramanujan/dp/B00C7F17OE/">very popular book</a> with the same title. There is a motion picture directed by Matt Brown
based upon this book.</p>
<p>I watched his movie on a Saturday at Berkeley. I was excited to listen to the QA with the director, and Mathematicians
such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borcherds">Richard Borcheds</a> , <a class="reference external" href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~oholtz/">Olga Holz</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/">Ken Ribet</a> following the screening.</p>
<p>In India, we have been exposed to Ramanujan quite early in our lives. I had stories in school book about great Indian
mathematicians like Aryabhata, Brahmangupta, and Bhaskaracharya. Indian Satellites to Space launched by ISRO bear their
names too. Along with those personalities, we have Srinivasa Ramanujan and whom we know for his invention of <a class="reference external" href="https://nrich.maths.org/1380">Magic
Squares</a>, and <strong>Ramanujan Number</strong>, <strong>the smallest number expressible as sum of two cubes.</strong></p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
1729 = 1^3 + {12}^3 = 9^3 + 10^3
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Beyond that, I had not known much about the significance of this number or Ramanujan's work.</p>
<p>Years later, when taking <a class="reference external" href="https://youtu.be/h_9WjWENWV8?t=14m48s">online courses</a>, I had come to know about Hardy and Ramanujan's research in Number Theory
being at the core of secure communication and cryptography. Do you use Credit Cards online and feel confident that
someone will not maliciously take your money? All this is was because of the research in number theory.</p>
<p>There is also famous anecdote associated with Ramanujan, known to many from South India, Ramanujan prayed to a goddess,
and she gave inspiration for his work.  He mentions that his theorems had come up like a dream, a boon granted by the
Goddess, and he would write formulae in his book. That's how he invented those theorems.</p>
<p>If it happened like that, imagine how excited young students from Madurai will
be, where there a temple every hundred feet. :) It needs to be clarified that,
Ramanujan was a genius and he also worked very hard on his subjects.</p>
<p>A better understanding of this phenonmemon, in general, is now known. The style of discovery is called
" <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbRc8uUKSHM">diffused mode</a> learning", wherein after an intense work on challenging
problem, the solution suddenly comes up during a restful time.</p>
<p>All these are portrayed well in this movie. The relationship between Hardy and Ramanujan, the scientific culture at
Trinity College, London revealed in real detail. The movie has a significant portion dealing with how Hardy mentors
Ramanujan, and strives to bring his work to the modern world.</p>
<p>In the question and answer session that followed, two questions were of interest to me.</p>
<p><strong>How do mathematicians study Ramanujan's work when he has not left many formula proofs with his equation?</strong></p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Borcherds">Richard Borcheds</a>, who is an accomplished mathematician, replied that Ramanujan's work was published in the form of
series of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.amazon.com/Ramanujans-Notebooks-Bruce-C-Berndt/dp/1461270073/">notebooks</a>. He left behind three notebooks containing almost 3000 theorems, virtually all without proof. The
reason he could have done that is perhaps he grew up in a time when the paper was very expensive for him and he wanted
to be economical.</p>
<p>(It did not answer the question, but provided a good perspective).</p>
<p><strong>Question 2: In the movie, Ramanujan is shown to be desisting writing formal proofs. Is that true?</strong></p>
<p>Richard Borcheds shared that, it is bit exaggerated in the movie. Ramanujan always knew the proof of his work and
could state it if he wanted to. But he usually did not.</p>
<p>I enjoyed watching this movie and listening to the perspectives associated with the genius from kumbakonam.</p>

<p>Oxford Comma is the final comma in the list of things mentioned in a sentence. In this statement,</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">I like computer science, maths, and programming.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>The comma after the word maths and before the conjunction, and, is considered the Oxford comma. Other commonly used
terms that refer to this style are the serial comma, a series comma, or a Harvard comma.</p>
<p>In my writing, before this essay, I had never added a comma on the final element of the conjunction. This topic piqued
my interest, and I started doing research on this entity.</p>
<p>The term, Oxford comma, got its name from the Oxford University Press style guide. It was recommended by the Oxford
style guide even when many British journals and publications were not recommending it. My first conscious encounter with
it was during the diagnostic test. I was not able to correct the sentence by placing a serial comma. I had never
considered a statement, with a list of items, wrong if it did not have a serial comma. We always try to infer the
meaning from the context. But in fact, as will see shortly, it may not be possible at all times and the reason to
include Oxford comma is to reduce ambiguity in the sentence.</p>
<p>The reason we do not notice the lack Oxford comma is, the Associated Press style guide, which many newspapers follow,
does not require us to use Oxford comma, and thus, it is often left out. Let's notice an ambiguity when we lack the
Oxford comma.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia and Steve Jobs.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an ambiguity about the writer's parentage here because Alicia and Steve Jobs can be read as in apposition to
his parents, leading the reader to believe that writer claims Alicia and Steve Jobs are his parents. Whereas,  placing
the Oxford comma after Alicia will resolve the ambiguity.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia, and Steve Jobs.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>It articulates clearly that the writer is referring to 3 separate entities in his dedication. There are cases when
inclusion of Oxford comma can make a sentence ambiguous too. For example, this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my father, Steve Jobs, and Alicia.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>The serial comma after my father creates ambiguity about the writer's father because it uses punctuation identical to
that utilized for an appositive phrase, suggesting that Steve Jobs is the writer's father. It is unclear whether there
are three people (1. my father; 2. Steve jobs; and 3. Alicia) or it is only two (1. Steve Jobs and 2. Alicia. Steve Jobs
is writer's father). The common way to disambiguate this sentence is to refer to each entity as a noun. For e.g.</p>
<blockquote>
<tt class="docutils literal">To my father, to Steve Jobs, and Alicia.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the placement of the comma can significantly affect the meaning of the entire sentence. By appropriately choosing
words and with always using Oxford comma, we can write less ambiguous phrases. Also, Oxford comma matches with the
spoken cadence of sentences better.</p>
<p>If you need only one reference to remember this concept, then keep this picture in your mind.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," said Siddhartha, "I make one-off changes to Simulations on Earth."</p>
<p>Govind adjusted his glasses and wondered. "Really?."</p>
<p>"I mean it. I make real people come to readings and discussions of their stories."</p>
<p>"And?".</p>
<p>"The characters themselves evaluate how they are understood. I introduced Asimov into a class which was doing a
discussion of his short story 'The Immortal Bard'."</p>
<p>"Oh wow, exciting."</p>
<p>"Asimov was excited too since it was his favorite subject. But, then."</p>
<p>"Hmm.?"</p>
<p>"He quickly became dismayed. His original writing of Immortal Bard was to illustrate, given enough time, how experts of
this world create their meaning of original sources. When creators themselves come to face them, they so much believe in
their interpretation and revisions that they fail the creator himself."</p>
<p>"That's what happened to Shakespeare in that story. Yeah, I know, that was a hilarious one. "</p>
<p>"Right, but what Asimov found was, the discussion was not about what he felt the readers might enjoy from his story.
Instead, everyone went on to prove, why the immortal bard will fail when he brings him back."</p>
<p>"Amusing."</p>
<p>"Yeah, Asimov pondered, how the story could be perceived and readers change the intention when asked to prove something
in an assignment. The Good Doctor that he was, continued with his writing, thinking that someday readers will be able to
enjoy his stories as he meant it, perhaps with the help of an artificially intelligent agent."</p>

And, when rushed, even professional scientists start making purpose-driven mistakes.

Rushing the scientists caused them to double their endorsements of false purpose-driven explanations, from 15 to 29
percent.

When looking only at the confidence of people getting 100 percent versus zero percent right, it was often impossible to
tell who was in which group.

The way we traditionally conceive of ignorance—as an absence of knowledge—leads us to think of education as its natural
antidote. But education can produce illusory confidence.

Every day, however, people rely on the cognitive clutter in their minds—whether it’s an ideological reflex, a misapplied
theory, or a cradle-born intuition—to answer technical, political, and social questions they have little or no direct
expertise in. We are never all that far from Tonya and the Hardings.

Because it’s so easy to judge the idiocy of others, it may be sorely tempting to think this doesn’t apply to you. But
the problem of unrecognized ignorance is one that visits us all.

The built-in features of our brains, and the life experiences we accumulate, do in fact fill our heads with immense
knowledge; what they do not confer is insight into the dimensions of our ignorance. As such, wisdom may not involve
facts and formulas so much as the ability to recognize when a limit has been reached. Stumbling through all our
cognitive clutter just to recognize a true “I don’t know” may not constitute failure as much as it does an enviable
success, a crucial signpost that shows us we are traveling in the right direction toward the truth.

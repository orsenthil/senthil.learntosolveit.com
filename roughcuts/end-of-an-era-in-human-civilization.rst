Go is an ancient game which humans have been playing for more than 2500 years. The game in it's current form remained
the same without modifications or revisions, no rules have been changed since it's inception, only board sizes were
increased from 17x17 to 19x19, some 1500 years ago.

Go has been considered a complex game, all through out our times, until now, it was considered that computers can never
beat a human in that game. Chess had already fall to machines in 1990s, and "go" was considered the human savior.
The science fiction authors of 1990s when they wrote about far fetched future in other planets, they imagined humans
playing a game of go with robots. Thinking that humans have an advantage over robots in this game.

Things are not the same anymore. In March, 2016, an Artificial Intelligent Program developed by a company called
Deepmind in UK defeated the current world champion of the game of go.

This is a momentous event in the history of not only computers, artificial intelligent, but in human civilization
itself. The crux of this change can realized from this question and answer with the man behind the driving force,
"Geoffery Hinton".

**Q: So what now? Are there other, even more complicated games that the AI world wants to conquer next?**

**A: From what we think of as board games and things like that, I don’t think there is—I think this is really the pinnacle.**

In other words, there is no board-game puzzle left which computers cannot solve!

It's an interesting thought to consider. We think, intuition is the key which humans have an upper hand over computers,
the game of go relied heavily upon intuition as calculation was simply not feasible, yet computers have defeated humans
in the game which relies upon intuition heavily.

So, what will humans remain better yet?

The control of deployment will still remain in the hands of humans.

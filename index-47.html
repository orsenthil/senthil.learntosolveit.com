<p>Some interesting quotes from this book</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-pursuit-of-truth">
<p class="first admonition-title">pursuit of truth</p>
<p class="last"><em>Then I took up measurements of minerals and I found that several of those
which contain uranium or thorium or both were active. But then the activity
was not what I could expect, it was greater than for uranium or thorium
compounds like the oxides which are almost entirely composed of these
elements. Then I thought that there should be in the minerals some unknown
element having a much greater radioactivity than uranium or thorium. And I
wanted to find and to separate that element, and I settled to that work
with Professor Curie. We thought it would be done in several weeks or
months, but it was not so. It took many years of hard work to finish that
task. There was not one new element, there were several of them. But the
most important is radium which could be separated in a pure state.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="admonition admonition-work-of-science">
<p class="first admonition-title">work of science</p>
<p class="last"><em>But we must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it
would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this
is a proof that scientific 5 work must not be considered from the point of
view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the
beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific
discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.</em></p>

<p>3Blue1Brown did an excellent video explaining exponential growth. He took the
opportunity to explain Covid-19, growth, trajectory and more importantly
pressing question on when this growth will stop using mathematical equations.
I was highly impressed. It helped to make sense of the situation, and help with
dealing with the situation.</p>
<p><strong>Please watch this video</strong></p>
<div class="youtube-video">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kas0tIxDvrg?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
<p>The video deals with the questions explained in the slide.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/46Tu2D9.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/46Tu2D9.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>Exponential growth means as you go from one day to the next, it involves
multiplying by a constant.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/Rk3p1TP.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/Rk3p1TP.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>In terms of an Equation the exponential growth is represented mathematically
like this.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/sTmqAyB.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/sTmqAyB.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>3Blue1Brown says that this data fits in a linear regression model.</p>
<p>Linear regression calculates an equation that minimizes the distance between
the fitted line and all of the data points.  And if want to find the equation
that minimizes the distance between a line and the data point, the most common
way is to find <a class="reference external" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html">"least square regression"</a> .</p>
<p>We will notice that the least square regression ends up with an equation of
line <span class="math">\(y = m \dot x + b\)</span> Where <cite>m</cite> is same as the multiplying factor the
exponential growth.</p>
<p>So he uses the data point to track the growth for linear regression.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/K1FQ7E1.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/K1FQ7E1.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>And finds out <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> which is a coefficient of determination,  a
statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.
We notice that <span class="math">\(R^2\)</span> is close to 1.0 which is a straight line, increasing
by a factor, <span class="math">\(m\)</span> each day.</p>
<p>He is making a point with logistic regression that, when a country has 100
times lower cases than another country, the country is not 100 times better,
but just 30 days behind!</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/BrhVPIU.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/BrhVPIU.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>And following the numbers, if we extrapolate, we will hit a 1 billion cases in
81 days. But that's hardly desirable, and everyone wants to know when we do
stop growing linearly and hit a plateau. He notes that "Linear Growth" is a
theoretical phenomenon, not a realistic one. Just like, if you were not married
last year, and you got married this yea, it does not mean, will you marry every
year from now. (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/605:_Extrapolating">Explain XKCD</a>)</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/q0h9nux.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/q0h9nux.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p>But unlike marriage, we <strong>are</strong> seeing an exponential growth here. We will have
to find out the factors that reduce the exponential growth.</p>
<p>So, in reality what we are expecting is a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">logistic curve</a> where the
exponential growth includes damping factor contributed by people who are not
infected.</p>
<p>Our whole idea, then becomes to <strong>increase this damping factor</strong>, that is not
get infected by this virus.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpRwguZ.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/vpRwguZ.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><p><strong>What makes the growth factor go down other than maxing out at the total population?</strong></p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/mAX2ICl.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/mAX2ICl.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"><ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Decrease the number of people getting exposed - aka social distancing</strong></li>
<li><strong>Decrease the probability of exposure - aka wash your hands completely, maintain hygiene amongst other things.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And important point to remember in this damping factor is, the <strong>output decreases exponentially too</strong></p>
<p>For instance with the growth factor of 1.15, we have the first number and
reduces significantly, only by <em>10%</em> decrease in the damping factor.</p>
<img alt="https://i.imgur.com/FltSCBb.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/FltSCBb.png"><img alt="https://i.imgur.com/aka3Jxt.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/aka3Jxt.png"><p>3Blue1Brown has tried to quantify our worry factor, and give us hope that by
social distancing, good hygiene we can reduce the damping factor and control
the growth. However, "If we are not worried, that's only thing to worry about".</p>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003927797">5 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
Bits are Bit. Even if they are transmitted through electrons in copper wires or light in fiber optical cables or via modulation in radio waves. All of these carry bits and run the world. This book covers the intersection between technology, society, the justice system, policies, and politics. It is highly approachable and helps you appreciate technology, not just from a technical standpoint but from a societal standpoint. I really appreciate the concern for fellow human beings put forefront in this book. It opens the reader's mind to care a lot about the political process and be aware that any technology we design is going to have a wide societal impact.

<p>This was an unbelievable interview with <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vapnik">Vladimir Vapnik</a>. He is the co-inventor of Support Vector Machines, one of
widely used statistical machine learning algorithm. In explaining his understanding of the world, he uses the
mathematical terms of predicate and functions.</p>
<p>He often went back to <a class="reference external" href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/storytelling/plots/propp/31_narratemes.htm">Vladimir Propp</a> to 31 functions that explained russian folk tales.</p>
<p>Vladmir Vapnik is a truly a humble, honest, accurate person, trying to <em>understand</em> and then solve a well defined
problem of Hand-writing recognition, within his lifetime. I was amazed while listening to him.</p>

<p><em>Short notes from my readings.</em></p>
<p>We all know that earth is a spherical, it has been taught to us since our childhood. The notion is so common that we
somehow suppress our original thought, when we observe outside, that earth could be flat.</p>
<p>That brings an interesting question on how and when did human first come to realize that earth is not flat. Mere
observation may not help as when we see around us, both cities and plains, that land we see is infinitely flat.
Occasionally, when we look at the mountains, we observe the land going up and then coming down, it is the same, but in
the reverse order when we observe it in the valley.  If we iron out these oddities, we still land up on the same
conclusion that earth could be flat.</p>
<p>However, careful observation and thinking by looking at the mountain, could help us derive at a different conclusion. If
we look up the mountain, we see a smooth line of the earth and the sky touching. If the earth were flat, than that
smooth line could be considered the boundary, in other words, horizon of the surface denoted by that horizontal line.
But, if we venture past that mountain top, we know that that is not end as we saw from the bottom, but there is a slope
down and then mountain was curved surfaced which looked horizontal to our eyes.</p>
<p>The same analogy could be drawn to a ship on the surface of an ocean and if we see a ship on the horizon, it slowly goes
down the other side, little by little and never jumps off the cliff. This can help us derive that earth is not just
flat, but it is a curved surface.</p>
<p>And we see this phenomenon throughout the ocean surfaces, which makes us believe that earth's curvature is uniform, in
other words, spherical.</p>
<p>This kind of reason was first explained by pythogoras in 500 BC. Later in 340 BC, Aristotle settled this matter once and
for all by providing numerous examples. Like, when observing lunar eclipse, when earth cast it's shadow on moon and we
can observe that earth's surface is curved.</p>
<p>Modern world does not need much proof, we have photos of earth captured from space, which asserts that pythagoros guided
the human thinking in the correct direction.</p>

<p>I planned for a family weekend trip to few coastal towns in California. My dad
was visiting us and before he returned back to India, I thought it was a good
idea to tour some nearby places. Plus, it was a welcome relief after all the
work of moving to the new home.</p>
<p>As my wife would say, something that I should avoid doing, it was last minute
plan. On wednesday, I went about planning for my leave at office and started
booking hotels. Hotels near tourist spots often get booked during weekends and I
had to pay my price of getting hold of something which was a bit away from
tourist spots, but in a beautiful small town called <a class="reference external" href="http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Salinas,_California">Salinas</a>.</p>
<p>Using wikipedia and google maps, I noted down the following places that will be
worth visiting.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pigeon_Point_Lighthouse">Pegion Point Light House</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mystery_Spot">Mystery Spot</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Cruz_Beach_Boardwalk">Santa Cruz Broad Walk</a></li>
<li>Piedras Blancas Light Station [cancelled]</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_Sur_Lighthouse">Point Sur Light House</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monterey_Bay_Aquarium">Monterey Aquarium</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission_San_Carlos_Borromeo_de_Carmelo">Mission San Carlos Borroméo del río Carmelo</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bixby_Creek_Bridge">Bixby Creek Bridge</a></li>
<li>Hearst Castle [cancelled]</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/sankat-mochan-hanuman-temple-watsonville">Mt Madonna Hanuman Temple</a></li>
</ul>
<p>We could make it most of them and I had to cancel a few because were very far
from the place we stayed.</p>
<p>I have visited Monetery twice earlier, I was enthusiastic to travel to the
peninsula again and take Siddhartha to Aquarium second time in row.</p>
<p>Santa Cruz beach has free concerts on Friday evenings and  we got a chance to
watch the live performance of of <a class="reference external" href="http://www.yandtrocks.com/">Y and T</a></p>
<p>At Bigsur, we could be on time for a 02:00 pm tour of Point Sur light house.
It's trek lasting for 3 hours up to the light house led by a guide, who has a
good narrative on light houses in california, living in early 1900s in the light
house and current preservation efforts.</p>
<p>Next day, we visited Mission San Carlos at Carmel, which was one of the earliest
missions established in California by Junipero Sierra. These monuments provide a
window to peek at events back in time. I enjoy watching through it.</p>
<p>On Monday, on our way back to home, we made a trip to Hanuman Temple at Mount
Madonna, Watsonville. This is actually a Yoga retreat setup by folks and is
guided by an Indian guru by name Baba Ram Doss. The location of this Hindu
temple was excellent and at atmosphere was serene.</p>
<p>That was our last spot in the journey. All throughout, we tried different local
foods, and sometim food chains as it was easy choice. We planned a little,
executed mostly on our plans.</p>
<p>Here are some of our <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/photos/fMz7sEm8kT5pJy3t8">Tour Photos</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">This is a <a href="2015/07/greatest_in_history.pdf">newspaper article</a> written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._G._Wells">H.G. Wells</a> published in 1935. The scanned version is not very readable, but the content is very interesting. I thought, I will republish it here for everyone's enjoyment.</p>

<h5>Greatest In History</h5>

<h6>CHOICE OF MR. H. G. WELLS CHRIST, BUDDHA, AND ARISTOTLE</h6>

<h6>Mr. H. G. Wells names Jesus of Nazareth, Buddha, and Aristotle as having had greater effect on world history than any other known figures.</h6>

<p><strong>Who are the three greatest men in history?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">SOME 13 years ago I was asked to name the six greatest men in the world, says,  Mr. Wells in the "Readers' Digest." I did so. Lately. I have been confronted with my former answer and asked if I still adhere to it. Not altogether. Three of my great names stand as they stood then-but three, I must add it, seem to have lost emphasis.</p>

<p>The fact is that there are not six greatest names to cite.There are only; three.</p>
<p style="text-align:justify;">When I was asked which single individual has left the most permanent immpression on the world, the manner of the questioner almost carried the implication that it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus">Jesus of Nazareth</a>. I agreed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He is, I think, a quite cardinal figure in human history, and it will be long before Western men decide-if ever they do decide, to abandon his life as the turning point in their reckoning of time. I am speaking of him, of course, as a man. The historian must treat him as a man, just as the painter must paint him as a man. We do not know as much about him as we would like to know; but the four gospels, though sometimes contradictory, agree in giving us a picture of a very definite personality; they carry a conviction of reality. To assume that he never lived, that the accounts of his life are inventions, is more difficult and raises far more problems for the historian than to accept the essential elements of the gospel stories as fact.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Of course, the reader and I live in countries where to millions of persons believe Jesus is more than a man. But the historian must disregard that fact. He must adhere to the evidence that would pass unchallenged if his book were to be read in every nation under the sun. Now, it is interesting and significant that a historian, without any theological bias whatever, should find that he cannot portray the progress of humanity honestly without giving a foremost place to a peniless teacher from Nazareth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The old Roman historians ignored Jesus entirely; they left no impress on the

historical records of his time. Yet, more than 1900 years later, a historian like myself, who does not even call himself a Christian, finds the picture centering irresistibly around the life and character of this most significant.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">It is one of the most revolutionary changes of outlook that has ever stirred and changed human thought. No age has even yet understood fully the tremendous challenge it carries to the established institutions and subjugations of mankind. But the world began to be a different world from the day that doctrine was preached, and every step toward wider understanding and tolerance and good will is a step in the direction of that universal brotherhood Christ proclaimed.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">The historian's test of an Individual's greatness is: "What did he leave to grow? Did he start men to thinking along fresh lines with a vigour that persisted after him?" By this test Jesus stands first. As with Jesus, so with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha">Buddha</a>, whom I would put very near in importance to Christ. You see clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for light, a vivid human personality, not a myth.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">He, too. gave a message to mankind universal in its character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to selfishness. Selfishness takes three forms-one, the desire to satisfy the senses; another, the craving for immortality; and the third is the desire for prosperity, worldliness.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself. Then he merges into a greater being. Buddha in different language called men to self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In some ways he was nearer to us and our needs. He was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ and less ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Aristotle Next. <span style="line-height:1.7em;">I would write the name of </span><a style="line-height:1.7em;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle">Aristotle</a><span style="line-height:1.7em;">, who is as cardinal in the story of the human intelligence as Christ and Buddha in the story of the human will. Aristotle began a great new thing in the world--the classifying and analysing of information. He was the father of the scientific synthesis. There had been thinkers in the world before, but he taught men to think together. He was the tutor of Alexander the Great, whose support made it possible for him to organise study on a scale and in a manner never before attempted.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">At one time he had a thousand men, scattered throughout Asia and Greece, collecting material for his natural history. Political as well as natural science began with him. His students made an analysis of 153 political constitutions. Aristotle's Insistence on facts and their rigid analysis, the determination to look the truth in the face, was a vast new step in human progress.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">These are three great names. I could write down 20 or 30 names. For the next three places. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad">Mohammed</a>? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius">Confucius</a>? I turn over names like Robert Owen, tie real founder of modrern Socialism. I can even weigh my pet aversion, Karl Marx, for a place. He made the world think of economic realities, even If he made it think a little askew.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Then what of those great astronomers who broke the crystal globe in whic man's imagination had been confined and let it out into limitless space. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon">Bacon</a>'s Predictions then in that original selection of mine. I find that my own particular weakness for Roger Bacon crept in. He voiced a passionate insistence upon the need for experiment and of collecting knowledge. He predicted more than six hundred years ago, the advent of ships and trains that could be mechanically propelled; he also prophesied flying machines. He, too, set men thinking along new, fresh lines, and left an influence that has lived for the benefit of all generations. But when I come to put him beside Christ, Buddha, and Aristotle-it won't do.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">Do you want an American in the list? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln">Lincoln</a>, better than any other, seemed to me to embody the essential characteristics of America. He stood for equality of opportunity, for the right and the chance of the child of the humblest home to reach the higest place. His simplicity, his humour, his patience, his deep-abiding optimism, based on the conviction that right would prevail-all these seemed to typify the best that America had to give mankind. Put, against those three who are enduring symbols of brotherhood and individual divinity, of service in self forgetfulness, and of the intellectual synthesis of mankind, what was rugged Abraham Lincoln?  Do you really want an American in the list yet? America is still young.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;">I think I will leave it at three.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Herbert George Wells</strong></p>

<p>Papanasam is the first movie wherein I noticed that Kamal Hassan as a character in the movie didn't make any fun of god. In fact, in one scene wherein he tussles with the inspector at the tea shop, he refers to people as capable of being judged only by "the almighty". That's more philosophical, but in a later scene he mocks a cinema operator as "Nee yeena Karuppu Sattai ya?" (Are you an atheist?)  taking the opposite stance he usually plays on the subject.</p>
<p>The movie is same as Drishyam and I didn't mind watching it again in Tamil. What I liked about the whole thing was even an accomplished actor like Kamal agreeing to act ditto and not shying away from a remake. This, in my opinion, is a credit both to the story as well as to the creative artist who wants to do the same project in a different language because the project itself is a brilliant one.</p>

<p>Our brain and memory works in an associative manner. Author of this book stresses upon this point
and gives good tools to create a associations for everything that we will like to remember.H is
consiciously driving the reader to make associations and explaining the fact that "applying your
mind" to something essentially means creating association.</p>
<p>I applied these techniques and found my joy in remembering new things and programming my mind. </p>

<p>It is well known that Kamal Hassan wants screenplay of movies to be of the <a href="http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/books/kamal-haasan-i-want-my-screenwriting-to-be-respected-as-literature">standards of literature.</a>  If Uttma Villian's screenplay is written as a book, then Indian readers will recognize and love the humor of Tennali Raman embedded within a story of a modern vacuous movie star, who as soon as he comes to face with his knowledge of death, strives for immortality through art, relationships and love.</p>

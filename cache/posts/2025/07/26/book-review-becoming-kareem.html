<p>Becoming Kareem will always be a special book for me because this is the first
book that my Son, Siddhartha, recommended and gifted me to read, after he
read it. He had purchased this book from his Montevideo school library sales,
and had enjoyed reading it.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was a chapter book designed for early readers, but man,
how wrong I was.</p>
<p>This book is about self-discovery. It is about a journey of a very relatable
boy, sharing his story with his friends, his interests in basketball, his
thoughts about his school, coaches, and his civics.</p>

He was a 19-time NBA All-Star, a 15-time All-NBA Team member, and an 11-time NBA All-Defensive Team selection. He was a member of six NBA championship teams as a player and two more as an assistant coach, and was twice voted the NBA Finals MVP. He was named to three NBA anniversary teams (35th, 50th, and 75th). Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time,  Abdul-Jabbar broke the NBA's career scoring record in 1984, and held it until LeBron James surpassed him in 2023.

did. I learned about Muhammad Ali, which I hadn't known before, and my respect for
him grew a lot more. I learned more about Malcolm X, and I am eager to read his autobiography now.</p>
<p>It is a wonderful book, and it was a joy for me to read this book.</p>

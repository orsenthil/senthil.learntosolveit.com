<p>Chromono is a visually appealing and aesthetic circular puzzle game. The game engine and physics is enticing. The rules are simple, you only have to make the circle of the same color overlap/touch with circle with the same patch. The game introduce challenges with bounce, physics and tricky circular structures.</p>

<p>The source code lives here, <a href="https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/tree/main">https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/tree/main</a>, and I had to fix for the build and runtime issues on Linux for OpenGL.</p>
<p>The game is written in C++11, and uses OpenGL. The <a href="https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/blob/main/architecture.md">architecture and technologies to learn</a> are exciting and modern too.</p>

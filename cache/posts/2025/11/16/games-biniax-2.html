<p>Biniax is a very simple, but interesting, vertical scrolling , matching game. You have to move you piece to collapse against the piece
of same color. The game ends when you are no longer able to collapse the pieces.</p>

<p>The game is written in ANSI C and uses SDL. I had to fix the source code for compilation, it is maintained here

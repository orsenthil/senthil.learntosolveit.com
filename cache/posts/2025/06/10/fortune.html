<h1>Technical Details</h1>
<p>I developed this with Python hosted on Google App Engine, and the client side written using Javascript as a browser addon. In the backend there is a database where I keep the quote and author in a table. There is API call that returns the quote and the author in the JSON format. To call the API visit <a class="reference external" href="http://quotes-1271.appspot.com/json">http://quotes-1271.appspot.com/json</a> . This is an unauthenticated API as it read-only GET call, and cannot change the state of the system.</p>
<p>The client side is entirely handled by Javascript, and it displays the quote using simple

            The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent API that treats an HTML or XML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects. DOM methods allow programmatic access to the tree; with them one can change the structure, style or content of a document. Nodes can have event handlers (also known as event listeners) attached to them. Once an event is triggered, the event handlers get executed.

<p>Teamcity is my favorite CI/CD tool. I like the intuitive architecture, and the
ability to customize the process. The hosted version of both the servers and
agents provide a lot of flexibility, and provides a transparent window into the
build process that I appreciate.</p>
<p>Configuring teamcity server and agent will require a bit of work. So, I created
this repository with the scripts to setup the server and agent.</p>

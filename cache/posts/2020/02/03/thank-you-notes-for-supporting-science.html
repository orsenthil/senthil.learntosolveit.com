<p>I had supported this project called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.donorschoose.org/project/modeling-is-key-to-understand-processes/4573244/">&quot;Modeling Is Key to Understand Processes, Structures and Scales!&quot;</a> by Mrs.
Sexton of Montevideo Elementary School for the fifth graders. They had this project going on for the family science
night in the winter of 2019.</p>
<p>On my birthday this year, I received a <a class="reference external" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/teWivefK8ZZPMJUa7">ton of thank you notes</a> for the supporting this project. It felt amazing to
see so many handwritten cards!</p>
<p>Thanks to students, and the teacher for this gesture. I will support your science efforts anytime! :)</p>

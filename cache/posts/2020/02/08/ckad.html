<p>I took 3 attempts to clear this exam. In my first attemp, I had forgotten the concepts.
I was not very confident during 2nd, and prepared well for the 3rd attempt to clear it.</p>
<p>I read &quot;Kubernetes from Ground Up&quot; again. Practised and &quot;understood&quot; the concepts better.
With all these, the tests were actually very enjoyable.</p>

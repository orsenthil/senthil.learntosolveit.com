<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>There we Einstein's thoughts on various topics. He desired a World-Government,
powerful and in control of Nuclear Weapons. Had a balanced view of both
Socialism and Capitalism. Readily allowed his critics to address their rebuttal
and answered that.</p>
<p>He writes In memoriam for fellow scientists and many other great leaders
of the world. He feels guilty for being associated with development of Atom Bomb
and urges Nations to work towards peace.</p>
<p>He shares ample stories about the difficulties Jews have through, supports the
Uprising of Warsaw ghetto.</p>
<p>The books reveals social and personal side of Albert Einstein.</p>

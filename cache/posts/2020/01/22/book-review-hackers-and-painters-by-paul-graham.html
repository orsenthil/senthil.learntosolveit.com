<p>My rating: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3133262402">4 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>Enjoyed reading Paul Graham's essays. It is quite dated, for example, with lots
of references to the Web in the 1990s and 2000s, a time when Yahoo was a
prominent .com company. Some of his opinions on wealth creation are still
applicable in 2020. However, we have to read his essays with plenty of
skepticism. He sings praise for Lisp and instills some desire in the reader to
study Lisp and start a startup.</p>

<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>This book is one of it's kind.
I had never come across a topic like this one.
It reads like a monologue but dwells a lot into History and societal norms.
It dwells in Native American history because the author is a native American,
and explains his life story and story of his friends in a compelling manner.
The incidents take place in Oakland, ca, and the reader familiar with the region
can relate to many incidents narrated in the story.
The story is an eye-opener for many to perceive the native American culture a
little broadly and in a practical manner.

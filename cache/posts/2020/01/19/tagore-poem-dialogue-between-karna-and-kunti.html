<p>I came across a translated work of Rabindranath Tagore's Poem: <a class="reference external" href="https://parabaas.com/translation/database/translations/poems/RT_Karnakunti.html">Dialogue Between Karna and Kunti</a>
The poem, even the translation captures the emotions between Karna and Kunti very well. We all know about this
episode of Mahabharata. In every critical interaction, Karna comes out as a highly ethical character.</p>

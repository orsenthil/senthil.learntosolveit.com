<p>Bill Gates has an article on <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/What-you-need-to-know-about-the-COVID-19-vaccine">What you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccine</a>
The entire article is impressive in terms of the approach to solve this problem. The particular highlight for me was
Bill Gate's emphasis on making sure <strong>everyone in this world</strong>, yes 7 billion people in this world get the vaccine as
soon as it is available.</p>
<p>This is an impressive thinking for a individual. Considering the solution for the entire humanrace, because no human
is different and is equally susceptible to this virus.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">7 billion doses</p>
<p>We need to manufacture and distribute at least 7 billion doses of the vaccine.</p>

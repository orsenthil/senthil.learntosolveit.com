<p>It is the year 2021, and I logged into one of my servers using IPv6 address. So far I had struggled with using IPv6
address for anything useful.  Today, I was able login to a server directly from my home using an IPv6 address.</p>
<p>vultr.com provides servers for USD 2.5 per month, with a <em>restriction</em> that it will only have IPv6 address.
But if you can ssh to it, why not get those cheap boxes?</p>
<p><code class="docutils literal">`bash
$ ssh <span class="pre">-6</span> root&#64;2001:19f0:5401:129f:5400:02ff:fea8:1fde
<span class="pre">root&#64;meet:~#</span>
`</code></p>

<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>This was a lengthy book.
The interviewers did a fantastic job with their questions and covered a range of
expert programmers and language designers across the spectrum.
The important thing I gained from reading this book was my &quot;enthusiasm&quot; again
for different programming languages and styles.
Each different language creator had some &quot;opinions&quot; about the state of affairs
and went about in a personal way to do something about it, create a language,
create a community, solve the problem, and usually building on top of what the
person had learned from others.
The language creation is both a scientific process (standing upon the shoulders
of giants), as well as the unique taste that each language designer brought to
the table.
I was excited to learn more about AWK, Haskell, Perl, and Eiffel as languages
after reading this book.</p>

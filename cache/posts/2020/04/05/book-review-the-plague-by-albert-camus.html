<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563469.The_Plague">The Plague by Albert Camus</a> by <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/957894.Albert_Camus">Albert Camus</a></p>
<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>The essence of this book is about sympathy.
The story is presented through the eyes of a few friends as they witness the
plague in the city of Oran.
The author, Abert Camus's writing, and the philosophy of the principal
character, Dr.
Rieux stands out in this Novel.
It will probably etch in the mind of the reader forever.
It is about sympathy, the qualities of truth, understanding, and comprehension
are at the core of it.</p>

<p>This book is about American Farming. I couldn't complete reading it as
it is a lengthy one, but the premise was America needs to take care of
farming as a personal profession which people can care about. The
mechanization has led to &quot;unsettling of America&quot; is the point of the book. I
took this upon recommendation from Mr.Sridhar Venbu in a tweet.</p>

            A blue moon refers either to the presence of a second full moon in a calendar month, to the third full moon in a season containing four, or to a moon that appears blue due to atmospheric effects.
            </span>
        </span> is a name given to an
irregularly timed full moon. Most years have twelve full moons which occur
approximately monthly, but each calendar year contains those twelve full lunar
cycles plus about eleven days to spare. The extra days accumulate, so that
every two or three years there is an extra full moon (this happens every 2.72
years).</p>
<p>So, its frequency of occurrence would be:</p>
<div class="code"><pre class="code literal-block"><span class="mf">1</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2.72</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">365</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">24</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">60</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">60</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">1.16580118</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="err">×</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">10</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">^</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mf">8</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Now, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=once+in+a+blue+moon">this one</a>
is good. Excellent humor!</p>
<p>But don't get how they arrived at that number. Average considering the <a href="" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=(3*(1%2F(2.72*365*24*60*60))+%2B+(1%2F(2.72*366*24*60*60)))%2F4&amp;btnG=Search">leap year</a>
does not result in that either.</p>

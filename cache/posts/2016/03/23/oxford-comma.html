<p>The Oxford comma is the final comma in a list of items mentioned in a sentence.
In this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="docutils literal">I like computer science, maths, and programming.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The comma after the word &quot;maths&quot; and before the conjunction &quot;and&quot; is considered
the Oxford comma. Other commonly used terms for this style are the serial comma,
series comma, or Harvard comma.</p>
<p>Before writing this essay, I had never added a comma to the final element of a
conjunction. This topic piqued my interest, and I started researching this
entity.</p>
<p>The term &quot;Oxford comma&quot; got its name from the Oxford University Press style
guide. It was recommended by the Oxford style guide even when many British
journals and publications did not recommend it. My first conscious encounter
with it was during a diagnostic test. I was unable to correct a sentence by
placing a serial comma. I had never considered a statement with a list of items
wrong if it did not have a serial comma. We always try to infer the meaning from
the context. But in fact, as we will see shortly, it may not always be possible.
The reason to include the Oxford comma is to reduce ambiguity in a sentence.</p>
<p>The reason we often do not notice the lack of an Oxford comma is that the
Associated Press style guide, which many newspapers follow, does not require its
use. Thus, it is often left out. Let's examine an ambiguity that arises when the
Oxford comma is omitted.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia and Steve Jobs.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is ambiguity about the writer's parentage here because &quot;Alicia and Steve
Jobs&quot; can be read as being in apposition to &quot;my parents,&quot; leading the reader to
believe that the writer claims Alicia and Steve Jobs are his parents. Placing
the Oxford comma after &quot;Alicia&quot; resolves the ambiguity:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="docutils literal">To my parents, Alicia, and Steve Jobs.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentence clearly articulates that the writer is referring to three separate
entities in the dedication. However, there are cases where the inclusion of the
Oxford comma can create ambiguity. For example, consider this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="docutils literal">To my father, Steve Jobs, and Alicia.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The serial comma after &quot;my father&quot; creates ambiguity about the writer's father
because it uses punctuation identical to that used for an appositive phrase,
suggesting that Steve Jobs is the writer's father. It is unclear whether there
are three people (1. my father; 2. Steve Jobs; and 3. Alicia) or only two (1.
Steve Jobs and 2. Alicia, with Steve Jobs being the writer's father). A common
way to disambiguate this sentence is to refer to each entity explicitly. For
example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code class="docutils literal">To my father, to Steve Jobs, and to Alicia.</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, the placement of the comma can significantly affect the meaning of an
entire sentence. By appropriately choosing words and consistently using the
Oxford comma, we can write less ambiguous phrases. Additionally, the Oxford
comma often matches the spoken cadence of sentences better.</p>

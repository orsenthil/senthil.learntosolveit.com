<p>Police shooting of the black men were disturbing. There are videos on the internet, I suggest that you don't watch
them, it just does not help. The men were shot for <em>no-good</em> reason and if I have take an alternate stance, it is
probably because the police officer had <em>fear and hatred</em> towards the other person that he shot them.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for the police officers who shot the black men. They should be jailed for their life term for this
act.</p>
<p>Later, the protest in Dallas to condemn the shooting, some people, who carried guns, which is legal in US, shot at the
officers and killed 5 of them. This is equally brutal. In addition, police used a robot to kill the suspect too.</p>
<p>I had to recollect &quot;Gandhi's message of peace&quot; that many Indians have been thought since childhood. It seems to me that
folks who cite, &quot;Second Amendment&quot; will really not understand either Gandhi's or Christ's message to mankind.</p>

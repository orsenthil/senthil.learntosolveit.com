            Adi Shankara (8th c. CE), also called Adi Shankaracharya (Sanskrit: आदि शङ्कर, आदि शङ्कराचार्य, romanized: Ādi Śaṅkara, Ādi Śaṅkarācārya, lit. 'First Shankaracharya', pronounced [aːd̪i ɕɐŋkɐraːt͡ɕaːrjɐ]), was an Indian Vedic scholar-monk and teacher (acharya) of Advaita Vedanta, who has popular become known as a major religious hero due to 14th century political and religious developments. While he is often revered as the most important Hindu philosopher, reliable information on Shankara's actual life is scant, and the historical influence of his works on Hindu intellectual thought has been questioned. The historical Shankara was probably relatively unknown and Vaishna-oriented. His true impact lies in his "iconic representation of Hindu religion and culture," despite the fact that most Hindus do not adhere to Advaita Vedanta.

predetermined lifespan of 16 years. Determined to make the most of his time,
Sankara studied all the scholarly works by the age of 10, became a monk, and
began preaching. When he turned 16, a debate took place between

            Vyasa (; Sanskrit: व्यास, lit. 'compiler, arranger', IAST: Vyāsa) is a rishi (sage) with a prominent role in most Hindu traditions. He is also known as Veda Vyasa (Sanskrit: वेदव्यास, lit. 'the one who classified the Vedas', IAST: Vedavyāsa) or Krishna Dvaipayana (Sanskrit: कृष्णद्वैपायन, IAST: Kṛṣṇadvaipāyana). Traditionally regarded as the author of the epic Mahābhārata, Vyasa also plays a prominent role as a character. He is also regarded by the Hindu traditions to be the compiler of the mantras of the Vedas into four texts, as well as the author of the eighteen Purāṇas and the Brahma Sutras.

Sankara. Vyasa, the original author of the work Sankara was discussing, engaged
in a prolonged debate with him. Unaware of Vyasa's identity, Sankara held firmly
to his stance. When the debate showed no signs of resolution, one of Sankara's
students called for a truce. Impressed by Sankara's profound knowledge of his
own work, Vyasa granted him a boon to live for another 16 years.</p>

            Srirangapatna or Srirangapattana is a town and headquarters of one of the seven Taluks of Mandya district, in the Indian State of Karnataka. It gets its name from the Ranganathaswamy temple consecrated around 984 CE. Later, under the British rule, the city was renamed to Seringapatam.

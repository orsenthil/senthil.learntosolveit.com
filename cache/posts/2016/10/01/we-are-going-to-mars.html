<p>A very exciting thing happened this week.</p>
<p><strong>Elon Musk laid out a plan for human beings like us to travel to mars and start a civilization there.</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi-year plan, and there will be multiple rockets carrying humans and cargo. It seems it will take 3 months
to reach to the destination and it has be done with Earth and Mars are in sync, which happens every 28 months.</p>
<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX team is trying to reduce the cost to a affordable level of 200K USD per ticket. If the ticket
happens to be more than 5x this, it will still be worth it.</p>
<p>The design of the rocket, the system architecture and the entire plan was really impressive. Here is the link to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/mars_presentation.pdf">presentation</a> that Elon Musk gave.</p>

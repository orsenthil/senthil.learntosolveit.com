<p>Enjoyed reading &quot;The Martian Way&quot; story by Asimov. Takes place in a future setting where there are dwellers in mars,
and Earth has decided to ration the supply of water to mars. Martians get worried, but a group, adventurous enough,
decide to get the water from &quot;elsewhere&quot; in the galaxy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Still thinking like an earthling?</p>
<p>Get out of your rut, open your mind—there’s a whole universe waiting. It’s waiting for people who aren’t afraid of thinking in new ways, of doing new things.</p>
<p>Can you imagine…</p>
<p>…mining the skies for water?</p>
<p>…building a new world beneath the surface of a strange planet?</p>
<p>…making pets out of alien explorers?</p>
<p>…putting your life in the hands of a teen-aged computer?</p>
<p>If you can, you’re well on your way to becoming a member of the space generation—you’re thinking The Martian Way.</p>

<p>I joined <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twitter.com/mesosphere">&#64;mesosphere</a> on June 20, 2016. It's exciting as I get to work on some interesting technology in <a class="reference external" href="http://dcos.io">Datacenter
Operating System</a>. The container technology and orchestration world is in rage right now. Mesosphere is suitably
positioned in that sphere. :)</p>
<p>The most interesting thing for me will be learn the distributed systems concepts well and contributed to this space.
Plus, I discovered that our infrastructure tools are completely in Python3. Yay for that!</p>

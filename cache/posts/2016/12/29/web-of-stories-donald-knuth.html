            Donald Ervin Knuth ( kə-NOOTH; born January 10, 1938) is an American computer scientist and mathematician. He is a professor emeritus at Stanford University. He is the 1974 recipient of the ACM Turing Award, informally considered the Nobel Prize of computer science. Knuth has been called the "father of the analysis of algorithms".

        </span> fan, and sometimes I strive to understand his lectures. Stumbled upon this website called
webofstories.com that feature many scientists and carries <em>extensive</em> interviews with them, who reflect upon their
life, their personal moments, their personal views on their achievements.</p>
<p>I watched the entire 3 hour interview with Donald Knuth and immensely enjoyed it.</p>
<p>One of the excellent moment was, when he shares his 2nd computer program, which was a learning tic-tac-toe. This was
written for the IBM 650 Machine having just 10K bytes of memory.</p>

<p>Those days, the programs were written in punched-cards and a typical program would look something like this (location,
instruction).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">0001 0000010000
0002 0000000000-
0003 1000018003
0004 6100080007
0005 2400008003
0006 0100008000
0007 6900060005
0008 2019990003</pre>
<p>Imagine writing an AI program in that. The difficulty of writing does not matter, just the possibility that it could be
written and could be very was exciting, probably led Knuth to write it. This video shows his excitement when he shares
that moment.</p>

as art, typography, religion, his dates, his wife, his children and awards he has won. Many interesting things can be
picked up.</p>

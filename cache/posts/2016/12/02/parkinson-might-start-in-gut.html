<p>Parkinson's is not curable (yet). Folks with Parkinsons will have a progressively degenerating muscular order.
But I have seen folks with Parkinsons live for very long time with only slight impairment.</p>
<p>It's well knowm it is a brain disorder and caused due to stress. There is a recent news (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38173287">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38173287</a>) that it might due to bacteria in the gut. If it were due to bacteria in the gut, then the cure is near.</p>

<p>After learning to program in C language, the next best thing to attempt will be writing some small utility in C.
I landed upon a great tutorial (<a class="reference external" href="https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/">https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/</a>) that taught how to write a shell with some builtin utilities in C. I tried that tutorial today and saw how to build a shell.</p>
<p>That's the best way to learn about the init, fork, parent process, child process and the shell loop itself.
As a side-effect, I also setup and used CLion on my computer.</p>

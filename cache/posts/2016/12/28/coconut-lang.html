<p>With the trend in functional programming up, I noticed a new programming language called &quot;coconut&quot; that implements
functional programing &quot;style&quot;. This is written on top of &quot;python&quot;, the coconut language scripts are compiled and
translated to python.</p>
<p>For e.g, this factorial coconut program, will be translated to a valid python program.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">def factorial(n):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Compute n! where n is an integer &gt;= 0.&quot;&quot;&quot;
    case n:
        match 0:
            return 1
        match _ is int if n &gt; 0:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    else:
        raise TypeError(&quot;the argument to factorial must be an integer &gt;= 0&quot;)</pre>
<p>You can notice the pattern matching style in the above program, which is not a syntax in Python. This program will then
be converted into a valid python program.</p>
<p>Great many details can be found in the coconut-lang website.</p>

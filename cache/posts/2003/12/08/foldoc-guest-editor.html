<p>My first open source community contribution came through editing entries for
FOLDOC. <a href="https://foldoc.org/Free+On-line+Dictionary">FOLDOC</a> is a free online
dictionary for computing. Denis Howe gave me an opportunity to (guest) edit some
of the definitions at The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing. I added entries
for <a href="https://foldoc.org/4GL">4GL</a> and <a href="https://foldoc.org/RPG-II">RPG-II</a>.</p>

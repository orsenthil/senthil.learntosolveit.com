<p>Interesting to watch this interview of 82 year old App Developer. She developed the app called <a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hinadan/id1199778491?mt=8">Hinadan</a> for people like her.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Wakamiya asked software developers to step in to develop her app. Uninterested, they suggested she make a game
herself. She took them up on the suggestion. Wakamiya soon bought programming books and
learned Apple’s Swift programming language through lessons with a programmer, nearly 200
miles away from her home in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture, via Facebook Messenger and Skype.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time that Wakamiya took on a challenge.
She’s been dabbling in the tech field since the age of 60.</p>
<p>Upon retiring from a 43-year career as a bank clerk (she began at age 18), Wakamiya spent long hours caregiving
for her then-90-year-old mother. Feeling isolated, and seeking connection with the outside world, Wakamiya
bought her first computer, then moved on to a Microsoft PC, and later a Mac and iPhones. In between learning
the piano, at age 75, Wakamiya eventually joined a computer club for seniors, Mellow Club, learning to
create Excel art along the way. Then, this past year came Wakamiya’s focus on creating the game Hinadan.</p>
<p>The app, based on the annual Japanese doll festival of Hina Matsuri, invites players to arrange
12 ornamental dolls — representing the country’s emperor, family and guests — in a specific
order. The game requires in-depth memorization of various arrangements, and has become especially
popular with older women, who enjoy playing it with their grandchildren, Wakamiya said.</p>

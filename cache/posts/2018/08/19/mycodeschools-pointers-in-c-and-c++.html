<p>To prepare for my next course with Introduction to Operating Systems I had to brush up my knowledge of C and C++.</p>
<p>I studied and worked through</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/">Essential C</a></p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/">Pointers and Memory</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>I found a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_">video series on Pointers in C</a>, by mycodeschool that helped clarify a lot of concepts with Pointers in C.
It started making me feel comfortable again. It is amazing to have resources like these when we are learning
difficult concepts today.</p>

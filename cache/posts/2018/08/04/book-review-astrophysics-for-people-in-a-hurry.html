<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>I loved this book.  This is a very short book, to the point, and explains the
universe in simple terms.  What I didn't expect and was a surprise to me was the
Author's humorous anecdotes, completely relevant to the present day reader
inserted between the concepts in the pages.  For e.  g.  It was funny to know
that behind US Govt which consumes Helium for military and research, the next
second highest consumer of &quot;Helium&quot; was Macy's for it's Macy's day parade.  It
was startling to know that life as we understand in any form, the single-celled
organism has started in existence only the last 2% of the history of the
universe.  The universe is very very old, very very big.  Often there is a
question on &quot;Is there life elsewhere in the universe?  &quot; - The more I read these
kinds of books, the more I realize that &quot;There is life elsewhere in the
universe.  Highly likely.  It is inevitable that either Earthians discover the
other life forms, and they discover the Earthians.  Also, the timeline of
advancement, the calamities that are possible in next thousand years, humankind
will, of course, take the ship, explore, and start settling in various other
parts of the universe.  Thinking like this doesn't sound like fiction to me.  It
was a great book.  I will start looking out for Neil De Grasse Tyson from now.</p>

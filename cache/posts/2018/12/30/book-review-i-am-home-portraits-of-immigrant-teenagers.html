<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>Memorable book.
It covers the stories of teenagers various different parts of the world like
Keren, Eritrea, San Salvador, Huehuetenango, and lots of places around the
world, who are now studying in Oakland International High School, and share what
they think, when they think of &quot;Home&quot;.
Book does a very good job of portraying the diversity that exists in OIHS.</p>

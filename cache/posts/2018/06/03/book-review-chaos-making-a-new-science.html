<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>I got interested in reading this book after hearing about this from Robert
Sapolsky in one of his lectures.
He had a very high regard for this book and states it had a tremendous influence
on him.
For me, I had to struggle reading this book.
This introduces the field of Chaos and presents the story and anecdotes of about
200 scientists who were involved with Chaos.
It's a challenge to present a cohesive story when someone is dealing with 200
investigators.
I felt frequent disconnects between one paragraph after another.
I could not follow the trail of the story, and in fact, I wondered if there is
any story at all here.
The book tries to lay a case that even after understanding Classical physics,
and Quantum physics, the scientists discovered new ways to reason about nature
using non-linear equations which depended upon the initial conditions.
The later part, the system of non-linear equations which depend upon the initial
conditions is called as the Chaos Theory.
I noted down the following interesting quotes from this book.
“John Hubbard, exploring iterated functions and the infinite fractal wildness of
the Mandelbrot set, considered chaos a poor name for his work, because it
implied randomness.
To him, the overriding message was that simple processes in nature could produce
magnificent edifices of complexity without randomness.
In nonlinearity and feedback lay all the necessary tools for encoding and then
unfolding structures as rich as the human brain.
” “The Mandelbrot set obeys an extraordinarily precise scheme leaving nothing to
chance whatsoever.
I strongly suspect that the day somebody actually figures out how the brain is
organized they will discover to their amazement that there is a coding scheme
for building the brain which is of extraordinary precision.
The idea of randomness in biology is just reflex.
” &quot;Shallow ideas can be assimilated; ideas that require people to reorganize
their picture of the world provoke hostility.

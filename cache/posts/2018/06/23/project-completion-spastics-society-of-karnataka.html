<p>I have been involved with Spastics Society Of Karnataka for more than 10 years. Today, we launched a new website
for the organization. Please check this out <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a></p>

            The Wayback Machine is a digital archive of the World Wide Web founded by the Internet Archive, an American nonprofit organization based in San Francisco, California. Launched for public access in 2001, the service allows users to go "back in time" to see how websites looked in the past. Founders Brewster Kahle and Bruce Gilliat developed the Wayback Machine to provide "universal access to all knowledge" by preserving archived copies of defunct web pages.
            </span>
        </span> to look at how this evolved.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>When I inherited this project, the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040521200831/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">website looked like this in 2004</a>. I don't remember the technology, but it was
done by a volunteer by name Mr. Nagaraj. He transfered the hosting and domain from  Net 4 India to us.</p></li>
<li><p>Then sometime <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523104054/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">in 2007 the website started looking like this</a>. I don't remember the technology that I used. It seems
I was using <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523172324/http://www.oswd.org:80/">open source web design</a>  and looks like I hand-coded it.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2008, we moved entirely to <a class="reference external" href="https://edu.google.com/k-12-solutions/g-suite/?modal_active=none">Google Apps for Education</a> - this was a great move. It facilitated online
processing, official email ids, all our data in a single place. This was like migrating Spastics Society of Karnataka
to the &quot;Cloud&quot;. The website changed its <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">look to this in 2008</a> using google sites.</p></li>
<li><p>The google sites website was not very pleasant looking. <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160721031435/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org:80/">This time in 2013, I updated website to wordpress</a>, and
hosted on bluehost.com and our domains were migrated to Google Domains. The wordpress website also had
accessibility features on changing font, style etc.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>There was problem, wordpress is not the most secure of the software that is present today. We got <a class="reference external" href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/webmasters/YayR1-iZ3x0/73Ig3qiWEQAJ">hacked by chinese hackers</a> who put up malware in our site.
This wasn't good. I removed the phishing, and they could still get to us. This happened for 2 months and I felt a
lack of control with wordpress.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We decided to shutdown and <strong>delete</strong> the wordpress site, and decided to rebuild it. For stop-gap, we directed
people to <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">Google Sites website</a></p></li>
<li><p>This stop gap solution lasted for more than a year because I did not want to rebuild it entirely with wordpress again.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2016, I decided to hand-code it using <a class="reference external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://orsenthil.github.io/sskweb/">built this</a> - This was hugely unappealing. It
was <strong>extremely secure and trustworthy</strong>, but felt very unappealing to everyone.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2018, we decided to make a appealing website, and this time I went with a hosted service, wix.com. The result is
what you see at <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a></p></li>

<p>This was a team effort. My friends Avinash and Nivedita got involved. We use Trello.com to track our tasks. From
school Preethi, and Priya  Madam and Sobha Madam got involved too. The website does not have

            The bus factor (aka lottery factor, truck factor, or circus factor) is a measurement of the risk resulting from information and capabilities not being shared among team members, derived from the phrase "in case they get hit by a bus".

        </span> of 1 and
this is an incredible feature.</p>
<p>The website was mostly done by Avinash. He cannot use his hands, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEwO17xd4eU">uses voice to operate his computer</a> So this
website was created using voice.</p>
<p>Simple theme, accessible on mobile and our google apps (cloud) still remain for forms, email and everything as it
is convenient to manage.</p>
<p>I believe this change is going to help school further. Given what I have shared above, this project is a living
entity, and will evolve with times.</p>

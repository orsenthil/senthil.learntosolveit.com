<p>When trying to understand the concept of radians:

            The radian, denoted by the symbol rad, is the unit of angle in the International System of Units (SI) and is the standard unit of angular measure used in many areas of mathematics. It is defined such that one radian is the angle subtended at the center of a plane circle by an arc that is equal in length to the radius. The unit is defined in the SI as the coherent unit for plane angle, as well as for phase angle. Angles without explicitly specified units are generally assumed to be measured in radians, especially in mathematical writing.

I came across the inventor of the concept Roger Coats:

            Roger Cotes  (10 July 1682 – 5 June 1716) was an English mathematician, known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication. He also devised the quadrature formulas known as Newton–Cotes formulas, which originated from Newton's research, and made a geometric argument that can be interpreted as a logarithmic version of Euler's formula. He was the first Plumian Professor at Cambridge University from 1707 until his death.

His name is not familiar to many. I understood, he is known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the
second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication.</p>
<p>Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, &quot;If he had lived we would have known something.&quot;</p>

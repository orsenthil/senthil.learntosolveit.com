<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>This is a highly influential book in the subject of how Computers work from
ground up.
They author deals with the subject and introduces computers as if they were a
natural evolution of inventions that had already taken effect and had proved
useful to the society.
After introducing the various needs for communication, the author explains how
it can achieved using bulbs, and then chips, and then how it is stored and done
at the higher scale using Computers.
He goes both in the Hardware as well as Software section of how computers work,
and why we need operating systems and programming languages.
The section on float point arithmetic caught my attention and imagination
completely.
This was a lucid explanation on storing decimal valued numbers using binary
digits.
I throughly enjoyed this, and is already helping me appreciate some of the basic
concepts used in Computers and Computer Science.</p>

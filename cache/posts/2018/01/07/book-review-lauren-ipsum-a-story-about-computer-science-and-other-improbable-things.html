<p>I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learnt some valuable computer science concepts too
since this was taught to a child, it was very easy to grasp. The concepts share are
foundational and it is presented in a neat, easy to understand manner. I internalized the
importance of &quot;naming&quot;, the thing with jargons and principle of 5-whys. Very helpful book.</p>

<p>I finished reading this book on Monday. It is an excellent book that tells the
stories of many physicists working during the prime era of physics. It starts

            Ernest Rutherford, Baron Rutherford of Nelson (30 August 1871 – 19 October 1937), was a New Zealand physicist and chemist who was a pioneering researcher in both atomic and nuclear physics. He has been described as "the father of nuclear physics" and "the greatest experimentalist since Michael Faraday." In 1908, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry "for his investigations into the disintegration of the elements, and the chemistry of radioactive substances." He was the first Oceanian Nobel laureate, and the first to perform Nobel-awarded work in Canada.

            Max Karl Ernst Ludwig Planck (German: [maks ˈplaŋk] ; 23 April 1858 – 4 October 1947) was a German theoretical physicist whose discovery of energy quanta won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1918.

as an example of being organized and disciplined in life. Max Planck was very
organized, it seems. He used to come to the lab almost at the same time every
day, and he had set aside half an hour daily for learning piano. His work style
was appreciated by many.

            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for "his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".

        </span> and others respected and loved him, addressing
him as "our Planck." Later, in Einstein's story, I learned that Einstein
resigned from his post in Germany during the troubled Nazi era, knowing that it
would fall upon Planck to make the decision of removing Einstein. Einstein
understood that Planck would feel uncomfortable doing it. Einstein then moved to

            Princeton University is a private Ivy League research university in Princeton, New Jersey, United States. Founded in 1746 in Elizabeth as the  College of New Jersey, Princeton is the fourth-oldest institution of higher education in the United States and one of the nine colonial colleges chartered before the American Revolution. The institution moved to Newark in 1747 and then to its Mercer County campus in Princeton nine years later. It officially became a university in 1896 and was subsequently renamed Princeton University.

            Niels Henrik David Bohr (; Danish: [ˈne̝ls ˈpoɐ̯ˀ]; 7 October 1885 – 18 November 1962) was a Danish theoretical physicist who made foundational contributions to understanding atomic structure and quantum theory, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1922. He was also a philosopher and a promoter of scientific research.

Einstein, was one of the primary characters in this book. Bohr had established
an institute where many young physicists loved to study and conduct experiments.
Physicists who had been there felt it was a golden era.</p>
<p>The final topic is on Einstein and Bohr's debate. Einstein believed that there
is an organized approach in God's design of the universe, whereas Bohr's point
of argument (as I understood) was that we have not yet understood the
organization of the universe enough to comment on it. Bohr was an athlete and
used to go for short sprints between scientific discussions and debates, it
seems. :-)</p>
<p>Many of my friends will enjoy this book. Jonathan gifted it to me while I was in
college, and Kannapan feels this is one of the best books he has ever read.</p>

            Ahimsa (Sanskrit: अहिंसा, IAST: ahiṃsā; IPA: [ɐ́.ɦĩ.sɑː]; lit. 'nonviolence') is the ancient Indian principle of nonviolence which applies to actions towards all living beings. It is a key virtue in Indian religions like Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.

            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is used worldwide.

            Fabbrica d'Armi Pietro Beretta (Italian pronunciation: [ˈfabbrika ˈdarmi ˈpjɛːtro beˈretta]; "Pietro Beretta Weapons Factory") is a privately held Italian firearms manufacturing company operating in several countries. Its firearms are used worldwide for civilian, law enforcement, and military purposes. Sporting arms account for three-quarters of sales. Beretta also sells shooting clothes and accessories. Founded no later than 1526, Beretta is the oldest active firearm manufacturer and one of the oldest continuously operating companies in the world. Its inaugural product was the arquebus barrel; by all accounts Beretta-made barrels equipped the Venetian fleet at the Battle of Lepanto in 1571. Beretta has supplied weapons for every major European war since 1650.

        </span> sucks</p>
<p>Bush and the Republicans were not protecting us on 9-11, and we aren't a lot safer now.  We may be more afraid due to george bush, but are we safer?  Being fearful does not necessarily make one safer.  Fear can cause people to hide and cower.  What do you think? What is he doing to us, and what is he doing to the world?</p>
<p>Are we safer today than we were before?</p>
<p>The more people that the government puts in jails, the safer we are told to think we are.  The real  terrorists are wherever they are, but they aren't living in a country with bars on the windows.  We are.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Your post inspired me to yet again give this a go too!</p>
<p>I found that I turned all other proxies off, then opened Synaptic and configure the proxy it worked!!! My Firefox was off too, so it is likely a conflict between the gnome proxy settings and the Synaptic proxy settings.</p>
<p>Note to others, if you need to configure your Gnome proxy settings, ensure you then restart Synaptic ;)</p>

<p>Only jarring note I have heard about Walt Disney is that he was a control freak. But that might be both his plus and minus. Steve Jobs could well become a worthy successor.</p>

<p>Thanks Loga. Even I too recollected my Kendriya Vidyalaya School days. It was fun on the teachers day wherein the teacher would also come and enjoy the class from the last bench. :-)</p>

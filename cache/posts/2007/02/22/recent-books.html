This is a compilation of early writings of Shashi Tharoor in his adolescence.
So, you might find him attracted towards pretty girls, interest in sex topics
and many things which disturb young adults. His writing style is good and it's
really funny. He in his college days might be a kind of leader who must have
been along with friends teasing, having fun, understanding junta and yet a
leader, not the all prefect high standards that comes in book definitions.</p>

<p>The title "5 Dollar Smile" refers to UN Post card featuring photo of a child
from India, which seeks to donate 5 dollars and make him smile. It's a simple
story of a boy with a charity. The stories are not conclusive, but many of them
are thought provoking and sometimes reflecting with real world incidents as they
happen and pass by.</p>

<p>A very good book stressing on moral values and principles in life. Sudha Murty
has narrated the incidents in her life in a very simple style for others to
understand and follow.</p>
<p>The title refers to the story of her youth, when she used to say featured
monthly story to her grandma and once in her absence her grandma felt helpless
with her inability to read. Her grandma took a resolve to start learning and
made young Sudha Murty as her guru. This has a very emotional touch at the end
which relates to a student respecting her guru.</p>
<p>Another thing imprinted in mind is, she learnt from a charity work of not
delaying things when helping people as help at the right time is proper and
delay with it is not good.</p>

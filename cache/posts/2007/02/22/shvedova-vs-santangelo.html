come to finals.</p>
<p>Santangelo is a 16th ranked player from Italy, while Shvedova who got an entry
to this tour due to absence of another Russian player is a ranked 119 and was
playing her first big tournament.</p>
<p>From the very start, Shvedova looked impressive and agile. When the match
started, her shots were more powerful and she tried for aces.</p>
<p>But Santangelo being a professional player was able to play effortless against
the novice and she made Shvedova run all over the court.</p>
<p>We began to guess that Shvedova would soon run out of energy and Santangelo will
take the match towards her side.</p>
<p>But this did not happen, Shvedova never got tired, she was able to play with a
top seeded player running all over the court and at last defeating her! Many a
times Shvedova won the set with Santangelo having the advantage. This shows her
energy the practise she must have put in.</p>
<p>It was a wonderful match and a great lesson to learn for a newcomer in any sport
that practise is the key to winning.</p>

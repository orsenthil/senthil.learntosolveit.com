            National Geographic (formerly The National Geographic Magazine, sometimes branded as Nat Geo) is an American monthly magazine published by National Geographic Partners. The magazine was founded in 1888 as a scholarly journal, nine months after the establishment of the society, but is now a popular magazine. In 1905, it began including pictures, a style for which it became well known. Its first color photos appeared in the 1910s. During the Cold War, the magazine committed itself to present a balanced view of the physical and human geography of countries beyond the Iron Curtain. Later, the magazine became outspoken on environmental issues.

website and sets it as your desktop wallpaper.</p>
<p>It currently works on Windows by leveraging Python for Windows Extensions, (using the <code>SETDESKTOPWALLPAPER</code> attribute from a Windows API call).</p>
<p>Future improvements include:
1. Making it platform-agnostic (support for Windows, Linux, and Mac).
2. Refactoring the code for better structure.
3. Implementing the program as a service or scheduled task.
4. Fixing the issue where the wallpaper resets after a few hours on Windows.</p>

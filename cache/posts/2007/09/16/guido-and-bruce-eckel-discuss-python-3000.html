            The programming language Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation was started in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at CWI in the Netherlands as a successor to ABC capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Van Rossum was Python's principal author and had a central role in deciding the direction of Python (as reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)) until stepping down as leader on July 12, 2018. Python was named after the BBC TV show Monty Python's Flying Circus.

        </span> stating that python community is missing to address some of the important issues with this major, backward incompatible release. Problems he mentions are concurrency support on multi-core cpus, easy deployment support, a standardized user interface amongst others. He expresses his dissatisfaction at the post titled <a href="http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214325">Python 3K or Python 2.9?</a>.

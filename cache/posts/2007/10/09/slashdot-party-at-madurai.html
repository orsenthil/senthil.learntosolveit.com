            The Nintendo DS is a foldable handheld game console produced by Nintendo, released worldwide between 2004 and 2005. The "DS" in the name is an initialism for "Developers' System" or "Dual Screen", reflecting the system’s most distinctive feature: two LCD screens working in tandem, with the lower screen functioning as a touchscreen. Both screens are housed in a clamshell design similar to that of the Game Boy Advance SP and some models of the Game & Watch series. The Nintendo DS supported wireless connectivity for local multiplayer over short distances, as well as online play through the now-defunct Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection service. During the seventh generation of video game consoles, its primary competitor was Sony's PlayStation Portable.

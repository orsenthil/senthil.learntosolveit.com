<p>This medical journal paper <em>Prevention of perioperative stroke in patients
undergoing non-cardiac surgery</em> states that stroke is preventable.</p>
<p>I was motivated to read this as the topic is close to my heart. I approached
and understood this paper using tools like <a class="reference external" href="https://fermatslibrary.com/p/fa8e26bd">Fermat's Library</a>, <cite>histre</cite> for annotation and
ChatGPT to understand medical terms.</p>
<p>Stroke was attributed to hypertension and psychological stress when patients
with hypertension were subjected to hospital care for the first time. Prevention
is possible by improving blood viscosity and addressing factors contributing to
hypertension.</p>

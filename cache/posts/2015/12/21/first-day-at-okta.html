<p>Joined my new company, Okta, today. Eventful day with lot of people and process training, but a meaningful one
wherein I got the feel of the pending tasks, by making change, going through the process, witnessing the test runs
and committing the code on the first day itself.</p>
<p>Onwards with Always On. :)</p>

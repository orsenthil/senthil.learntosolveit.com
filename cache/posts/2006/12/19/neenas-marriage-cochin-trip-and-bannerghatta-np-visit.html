        </span> to attend Neena's marriage. It was one of the
shortest marriages I have ever seen. The entire marriage ceremony took just 30
minutes to complete. This was my first time witnessing a Malayali marriage.</p>
<p>After the marriage, we went to the Cochin Harbour to spend some time. At Cochin,
I discovered that they use boats as a mode of public transport! That was quite
interesting.</p>
<p>Back in Bangalore, this weekend, I visited

        </span> with
Vaishnavi, Shiva, and Dad. Vaishnavi wanted to see the new Butterfly Park opened
at BNP, but after the Grand Safari and Zoo visit, by the time we reached the
Butterfly Park, it was already 5:30 PM, and it had closed. Next time, we plan to
visit the Butterfly Park exclusively.</p>
<p>During the Grand Safari, I managed to capture some great snaps of tigers. The
cab driver helped me with some of the shots, and he even captured a few himself.
I paid him Rs.10/- for this extra service. :-) However, I wasn't entirely
satisfied as I had hoped to improve my photography skills with some wildlife
shooting.</p>

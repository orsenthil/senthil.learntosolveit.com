<p>That article is very insightful. It analyzes how mathematics can be useful to
any programmer at any time.</p>
<p>We have all lost touch with basic mathematics and need to gear up. His
suggestion is that mathematics should be learned breadth-first and not
depth-first. By knowing different mathematical solutions, we can identify which
section a problem belongs to and approach it correctly.</p>
<p>Another suggestion for all of us is to start with any math section on Wikipedia,
follow it until we understand it, and make it a daily habit.</p>

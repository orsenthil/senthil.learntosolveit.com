            Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian lawyer, anti-colonial nationalist, and political ethicist who employed nonviolent resistance to lead the successful campaign for India's independence from British rule. He inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world. The honorific Mahātmā (from Sanskrit, meaning great-souled, or venerable), first applied to him in South Africa in 1914, is used worldwide.

            Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born  German politician who was the dictator of Germany during the Nazi era, which lasted from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He rose to power as the leader of the Nazi Party, becoming the chancellor of Germany in 1933 and then taking the title of Führer und Reichskanzler in 1934. Germany's invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 under his leadership marked the outbreak of the Second World War. Throughout the ensuing conflict, Hitler was closely involved in the direction of German military operations as well as the perpetration of the Holocaust, the genocide of about six million Jews and millions of other victims.

            Ahimsa (Sanskrit: अहिंसा, IAST: ahiṃsā; IPA: [ɐ́.ɦĩ.sɑː]; lit. 'nonviolence') is the ancient Indian principle of nonviolence which applies to actions towards all living beings. It is a key virtue in Indian religions like Hinduism, Jainism, and Buddhism.

upon a link discussing that letter in the Wikipedia article on Mahatma
Gandhi.</p>
<p>Here is an article that discusses <a href="http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/fascism/gandhihitler.html">Gandhi's letters to Hitler</a>.
We learn that Gandhi addressed Hitler as his friend and emphasized that it was
not just words—he truly believed in universal friendship and extended it to
Hitler as well. This was during a time when Hitler was suggesting to the British
that killing Gandhi would suppress the Indian rebellion.</p>
<p>The article discusses various political instances where Gandhi's ideologies
could have been applied. One can notice that the author gives a favorable
treatment of Gandhi's ideologies in these situations. The last paragraph of the
article was particularly impressive.</p>
<p>To quote from the article itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not certain that this would have worked, but then Gandhism is not
synonymous with effectiveness. Gandhi's methods were successful in dissuading
the British from holding on to India, not in dissuading the

            World War II or the Second World War (1 September 1939 – 2 September 1945) was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies and the Axis powers. Nearly all of the world's countries participated, with many nations mobilising their resources in pursuit of total war. Tanks and aircraft played major roles, enabling the strategic bombing of cities and delivery of the first and only nuclear weapons ever used in war. World War II is the deadliest conflict in history, causing the death of 70 to 85 million people, more than half of whom were civilians. Millions died in genocides, including the Holocaust, and by massacres, starvation, and disease. After the Allied victory, Germany, Austria, Japan, and Korea were occupied, and German and Japanese leaders were put on trial for war crimes.

        </span>. By contrast, there simply cannot be two opinions on
whether that approach of non-violent dissuasion would have been Gandhian. The
Mahatma would not have been the Mahatma if he had preferred any other method.
Our judgment of his letters to Hitler must be the same as our judgment of
Gandhism itself: either both represented a lofty ethical alternative to the more
common methods of power politics, or both were erroneous and ridiculous.</p>

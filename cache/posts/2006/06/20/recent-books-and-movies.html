            The Mythical Man-Month: Essays on Software Engineering is a book on software engineering and project management by Fred Brooks first published in 1975, with subsequent editions in 1982 and 1995. Its central theme is that adding manpower to a software project that is behind schedule delays it even longer. This idea is known as Brooks's law, and is presented along with the second-system effect and advocacy of prototyping.

    A good movie. I initially wanted to watch it after reading the book but decided to watch it anyway. I found it very interesting.
    The movie is gripping even if you know the story. It presents an alternative history suggesting that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, they had a child, and their lineage continues to this day.</p>

It was my first J.R.R. Tolkien book. I had purchased it in 2005 and
started reading it a few months ago. After some breaks, I finally had time to
finish it today.</p>
<p>Tolkien's English is superb! Now, I understand why he has so many fans
worldwide. The book captures your imagination and transports you to the world of
hobbits. The descriptions of events are vivid and engaging, creating a strong
interest in the reader.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended reading</strong> for anyone who has not yet explored J.R.R. Tolkien's works.</p>

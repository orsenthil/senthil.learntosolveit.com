<p><strong>Subject:</strong> [Rapple-devel] Rapple 1.0 Released!</p>
<hr>
<p>I have just released Rapple 1.0 via FRS onto SourceForge.net. This release
(along with tests, resources, and website docs) has been tagged <code>Release-1_0</code>.</p>
<p>Many thanks to all involved in meeting this deadline. There are still places
where we can improve and features we can add, but I think it is important that a
functional version is made public so that we can begin to understand how end
users see the tool. The progress we have made so far in quality (e.g., unit test
framework) and documentation (e.g., Doxygen and website) is great and gives us a
good basis to start from.</p>
<p>I have tentatively put together a roadmap for release 1.1 (you can see this on
the website now), so let's put some ideas together for what should be done and
what we need to fix or improve on in the current implementation!</p>
<p>Thanks for all your input!</p>
<p><strong>Regards,</strong>
Alan</p>

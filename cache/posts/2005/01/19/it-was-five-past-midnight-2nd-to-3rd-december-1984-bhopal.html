            Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity. Einstein also made important contributions to quantum theory. His mass–energy equivalence formula E = mc2, which arises from special relativity, has been called "the world's most famous equation". He received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics for "his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect".

            On 3 December 1984, over 500,000 people in the vicinity of the Union Carbide India Limited pesticide plant in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India were exposed to the highly toxic gas methyl isocyanate, in what is considered the world's worst industrial disaster. A government affidavit in 2006 stated that the leak caused approximately 558,125 injuries, including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries. Estimates vary on the death toll, with the official number of immediate deaths being 2,259. Others estimate that 8,000 died within two weeks of the incident occurring, and another 8,000 or more died from gas-related diseases. In 2008, the Government of Madhya Pradesh paid compensation to the family members of victims killed in the gas release, and to the injured victims.

this book.</p>
<p>The story begins with Ratan Nadar, a typical Adivasi Indian peasant, and follows
the fate of his family. Without any rhetorical exaggeration, the narrative
presents most of the information objectively. Ratan Nadar's children, aged 5, 6,
and 8, work in a match factory handling toxic chemicals. One day, a fire breaks
out, and Padmini, the eldest, tragically discovers her brother dead.</p>
<p>Ratan, like many others, continuously faces hardships in his village. Seeking a
better life, he moves to Bhopal, a bustling city, and secures a job as a worker
constructing the Bhopal Railway Station.</p>

        </span> develops Sevin pesticide, which promises to improve crop
productivity, and plans to establish a factory in Bhopal, India. Eduardo Munoz,
the chief architect, questions the necessity of such a factory in India, given
the country's unique challenges. However, Union Carbide's board of directors
dismisses his concerns, driven by profit motives.</p>
<p>While the motives are profit-oriented, the story also highlights several earnest
individuals who establish and work at the Union Carbide plant in India,
portraying it as a dream company for many.</p>
<p>Things take a darker turn.</p>
<p>The book delves into the lives of people living in Oriya Bustee and Kali Ghats,
exploring their customs, work, and relationship with Union Carbide. It examines
how circumstances evolve, how people come together to support one another in
times of real need, and how indifference can sometimes lead to devastating
consequences.</p>

            LILO (Linux Loader) is a bootloader for Linux and was the default boot loader for most Linux distributions prior to the widespread adoption of GRUB in the early 2000s.  Unlike loadlin, LILO allowed booting Linux without having DOS on the computer. As of 2009, most distributions have switched to GRUB as the default boot loader. Further development of LILO was discontinued in December 2015 along with a request by Joachim Wiedorn for potential developers.

            Linux ( LIN-uuks) is a family of open source Unix-like operating systems based on the Linux kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged as a Linux distribution (distro), which includes the kernel and supporting system software and libraries—most of which are provided by third parties—to create a complete operating system, designed as a clone of Unix and released under the copyleft GPL license.

it can boot Linux kernel images from floppy disks and hard disks and can even
boot other operating systems. One of up to sixteen differernt images can be
selected at boot time. Various parameters, such as the root device, can be set
independently for each kernel. LILO can even be used as the master boot record.</p>

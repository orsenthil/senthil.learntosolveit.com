<p>I had planned to complete a lot of extra work over the weekend, but everything
vaporized. :)</p>
<p>I did glance through some tasks, like reviewing the patent application from Ed
and quickly going through the 1855MC presentation, which I have to give on
Tuesday. However, I missed reviewing the RPM documentation, revising test cases
(there are about 22 comments), and completing some office work.</p>
<p>I went to the office on Saturday for a brief period and managed to reproduce one
issue, which required quite a lot of setup time. Afterward, I started playing
one of my favorite games: Blade of Darkness. I remember playing this a lot when
I was at home, and my sisters enjoyed it too. The Codemasters, the company that
develops the game, has the tagline "Genius at Play." :)</p>
<p>I was thinking about calling Gowri and Susila, but I missed it again. I have put
the SIM in my mobile, so probably the first thing tomorrow should be to make
that call.</p>
<p>I got two VCDs: <em>Anbe Sivam</em> and <em>I, ROBOT</em>.</p>
<p><em>Anbe Sivam</em> was interesting. I enjoyed the initial jokes between Kamal and
<em>Madhavan a lot. For instance, Madhavan is frantic about making a call and is
</em>already annoyed with Kamal, who keeps interrupting him with his chatter.
<em>Madhavan, having damaged his cell phone by plugging in a wet battery, speaks to
</em>the hotel receptionist to arrange a call.</p>
<p>Madhavan: Can I make a STD Call?
Other end: No Sir,</p>
<p>Trunk Call?
No,Sir.</p>
<p>Fax?
No,Sir.</p>
<p>Email?
No,Sir.</p>
<p>Courier?
No,Sir.</p>
<p>M:Post Man?
No,Sir.</p>
<p>Kamal Interrupts: Pura ( Pegion).
Madhavan: Pura?
Madhavan turns;looks at Kamal, wondering!</p>
<p>These are funny moments, but the film as a whole has many scenes with very deep
meaning. While reflecting on this later, I thought Kamal could have given his
role to someone else; the story might have resonated more with the audience.</p>
<p>I am by no means denying Kamal's role, but I felt that prioritizing the film and
its meaning above everything else might have been better. Kamal, as we know, is
an accomplished actor, and this was yet another excellent performance. However,
how would it have been if Nalla Sivam was portrayed by another actor alongside
A. Arasu? Hard to imagine, right? I am merely exploring ways in which the
movie's message could have been conveyed more prominently.</p>

<p>Saturday started with a bit of Uthcode, and Sunday's morning till afternoon was
spent on the same. I am glad that I have completed Chapter 5 of K&amp;R. The
Recursive Descent Parser problems had me gasping for a long time, but I have
finally gotten past them. Revisions on it will probably make me more comfortable
with the topic.</p>
<p>I called Giri, but he was already roaming with other friends when I called. I
slept a little at home and thought, "If I don't enjoy today (go out today), then
it will be a tough week ahead!" So, I called Parthi. We had planned to go to
Giri's home this Sunday but missed it. Instead, we went to MG Road, watched
Shark Tales, had popcorn, a burger, and two coffees in between. After the movie,
we went to Amoeba, tried

            Dance Dance Revolution (ダンスダンスレボリューション, Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon) (DDR) is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.

        </span> :). We spent some time talking, and it was already 10 PM by the time I
returned home.</p>
<p>Returned home and scribbling this.</p>
<p>Hey, someone reading till this line: Read the book "Five Point Someone." It is
very interesting! I spent some time on it as well. :)</p>
<p>(Hope this blog answers everyone—mom, aunt, sisters, friends—who might be
wondering what I was doing without giving a call.)</p>

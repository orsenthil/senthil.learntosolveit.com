            C is a general-purpose programming language. It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and remains widely used and influential. By design, C gives the programmer relatively direct access to the features of the typical CPU architecture, customized for the target instruction set. It has been and continues to be used to implement operating systems (especially kernels), device drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is used on computers that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest microcontrollers and embedded systems.

            Freecode, formerly Freshmeat, was a website owned by BIZX, Inc., hosting mainly open-source software for programmers and developers. Among other things, the site also hosted user reviews and discussions. While a majority of the software covered is open source for Unix-like systems, Freecode also covered releases of closed-source, commercial and cross-platform software on Mac OS X and handhelds. Freecode was notable for its age, having started in 1997 as the first web-based aggregator of software releases.

        </span> site is a good place to announce new code. (It is a
strange web site name, but they are legit and THE place to announce new code).
Support the code that you publish.  Start small and work your way up ... Some of
my more popular code is actually small code fragments that are used by others
over and over again.  Don't be discouraged if nobody (or if only a few people)
uses some of your early programs. What is important is to practice writing
quality, well commented code ... to maintain and fix that code.</p>
<p>I found this really useful and inspirational once again.

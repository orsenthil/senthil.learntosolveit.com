<p>The pasta theory of design:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Spaghetti: each piece of code interacts with every other piece of code [can be implemented with GOTO, functions, objects]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lasagna: code has carefully designed layers. Each layer is, in theory independent. However low-level layers usually cannot be used easily, and high-level layers depend on low-level layers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ravioli: each part of the code is useful by itself. There is a thin layer of interfaces between various parts [the sauce]. Each part can be usefully be used elsewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>...but sometimes, the user just wants to order "Ravioli", so one coarse-grain easily definable layer of abstraction on top of it all can be useful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An application design using Twisted's Aspect Oriented Programming Design is that special Ravioli.</p>

            Shavarsh Vladimiri (Vladimirovich) Karapetyan (Armenian: Շավարշ Կարապետյան; born 19 May 1953) is a Soviet-Armenian former finswimmer. He was best known for saving the lives of 20 people in a 1976 incident in Yerevan.

<p>Karapetyan had just completed his usual distance of 20 km (12 mi) when he heard
the sound of the crash and saw the sinking trolleybus which had gone out of
control and fallen from the dam wall.</p><p>The trolleybus lay at the bottom of
the reservoir some 25 metres (80 ft) offshore at a depth of 10 metres (33 ft).
Karapetyan swam to it and, despite conditions of almost zero visibility, due to
the silt rising from the bottom, broke the back window with his legs. The
trolleybus was crowded, it carried 92 passengers and Karapetyan knew he had
little time, spending some 30 to 35 seconds for each person he
saved.</p><p>Karapetyan managed to rescue 20 people (he picked up more, but only
20 survived), but this ended his sports career: the combined effect of cold
water and the multiple wounds he received (scratched by glass), left him
unconscious for 45 days. Subsequent sepsis, due to the presence of raw sewage in
the lake water, and lung complications prevented him from continuing his sports
career.</p><p>On February 19th, 1985, Shavarsh just happened to be near a
burning building, that had people trapped inside. He rushed in and started
pulling people out without a second thought. Once again, he was badly hurt
(severe burns) and spent a long time in the hospital.</p><p></p>
<p>He later moved to Moscow and founded a shoe company called "Second Breath". Karapetyan was later awarded a UNESCO "Fair Player" medal for his heroism.</p><p>A

            The asteroid belt is a torus-shaped region in the Solar System, centered on the Sun and roughly spanning the space between the orbits of the planets Jupiter and Mars. It contains a great many solid, irregularly shaped bodies called asteroids or minor planets. The identified objects are of many sizes, but much smaller than planets, and, on average, are about one million kilometers (or six hundred thousand miles) apart. This asteroid belt is also called the main asteroid belt or main belt to distinguish it from other asteroid populations in the Solar System.

            An asteroid is a minor planet—an object larger than a meteoroid (thus 1 meter or larger) that is neither a planet nor an identified comet—that orbits within the inner Solar System or is co-orbital with Jupiter (Trojan asteroids). Asteroids are rocky, metallic, or icy bodies with no atmosphere, and are broadly classified into C-type (carbonaceous), M-type (metallic), or S-type (silicaceous). The size and shape of asteroids vary significantly, ranging from small rubble piles under a kilometer across to Ceres, a dwarf planet almost 1000 km in diameter. A body is classified as a comet, not an asteroid, if it shows a coma (tail) when warmed by solar radiation, although recent observations suggest a continuum between these types of bodies.

            The following is a partial list of minor planets, running from minor-planet number 3001 through 4000, inclusive. The primary data for this and other partial lists is based on JPL's "Small-Body Orbital Elements" and data available from the Minor Planet Center. Critical list information is also provided by the MPC, unless otherwise specified from Lowell Observatory. A detailed description of the table's columns and additional sources are given on the main page including a complete list of every page in this series, and a statistical break-up on the dynamical classification of minor planets.

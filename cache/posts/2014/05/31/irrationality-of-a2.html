<p>Came across this <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/MorenoSqRt3.shtml">interesting piece of Maths History</a>.</p>
<p>The discovery of the irrationality of √2 is sometimes credited to Hippasus of
Metapontum (5th century BC), a Greek Pythagorean philosopher who was finally
drowned at sea as a punishment from his peers, the Pythagoreans, for divulging
the existence of the irrational numbers (the Pythagoreans advocate the idea that
all numbers SHOULD be the ratio of two integers).</p>

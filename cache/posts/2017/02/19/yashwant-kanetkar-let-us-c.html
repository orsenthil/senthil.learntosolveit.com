<p>I came across an article about <a class="reference external" href="https://yourstory.com/2017/01/techie-tuesdays-yashavant-kanetkar/">Yashwant Kanetkar</a>, and it rekindled many of my fond memories.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let Us C is not merely a book, but a bible for millions of programmers in India.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is true for me. I had read it during years 2000-2002, and I kept a count of it. I read, solved all the
problems in that book for more than 100 times.</p>
<p>It has helped me a lot and I am indebted to that book.</p>
<p>I also watched a short talk by Yashwant Kanetkar in which he explores his journey, and has some words of advice for
programmers from India.</p>

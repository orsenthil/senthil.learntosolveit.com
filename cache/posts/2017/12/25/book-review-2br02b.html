<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book.
This was the first Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to
expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on
population control in a weird way.
I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as
it would be a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on
the bigger picture than question some of the assumptions.
The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!</p>

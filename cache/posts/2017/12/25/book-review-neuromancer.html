<p>My rating: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2225014421">2 of 5 stars</a></p>
<p>I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as &quot;Artiste&quot; and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.</p>

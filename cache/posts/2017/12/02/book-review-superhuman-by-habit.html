<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>The value of this book will be measured by how much I could utilize the tips
giving in this book to improve my self-discipline.
I will never give a 5-rating for a self-improvement book.
The 4 rating is for excellent language and conversational style of this book.
The book is well written, it is based on good research, solid principles and
explained it's propositions well.
Towards the end, it had some &quot;selling&quot; of stuff that author personally liked.
But that's it, nothing negative about it.</p>

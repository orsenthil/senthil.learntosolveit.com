<p>Looks like Google celebrated Subramanya Chandrasekhar's 107'th birthday with a doodle.
I had missed it, so I got excited to go check it out again.</p>

<p>The doodle is amazing! It illustrates the concept of a star when it gains 1.4
times the mass of sun will turn into white-dwarf and eventually into a
black-hole!</p>
<p>Chandrasekhar discovered this, and it is known as Chandrasekhar's limit.</p>

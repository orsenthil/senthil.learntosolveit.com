<p>My rating: 4 of 5 stars</p>
<p>Funny writing.
Made me chuckle at times and was very imaginative.
makes for a light hearted reading.</p>
<p>I started reading this book using a hardcopy that I had for long time. For convenience, I quickly finished by reading the online ebook at <a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/308/308-h/308-h.htm">Project Gutenberg</a> . Since I read fast, I did't enjoy this very much. Won't discuss this much.</p>

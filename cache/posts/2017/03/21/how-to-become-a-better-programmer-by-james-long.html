<p>I might have stumbled upon this via hackernews and this topic is of perennial interest to me. The general advice
given were helpful. I liked the specific, measurable suggestions too. These were:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Learn C  - <em>I know C. I have written C. I will need to get back to writing in C.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Write a compiler  - <em>Not yet.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Learn macros - <em>Not yet.</em></p></li>
<li><p>SICP - <em>Not yet.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Understand continuations - <em>Not yet.</em></p></li>
<li><p>If anything, just try a new language - <em>I try this every now and then. The emphasis on his post were learning functional languages which, I think, I will be starting this year.</em></p></li>
</ul>

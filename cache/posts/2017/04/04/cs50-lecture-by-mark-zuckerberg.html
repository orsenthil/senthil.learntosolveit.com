</div><p>Listened to this guest lecture  by Mark Zuckerberg in 2005. He was not world famous then yet, so the
audience size is small and they ask pointed questions about facebook. This was supposed to be a computer
science class, and Mark chides multiple times at the crowd that they are not asking CS questions yet.</p>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg's personality comes out well in this lecture. The interesting things that
a computer science engineer can pick up is, Mark suggests, knowing &quot;C&quot; you could jump to
&quot;PHP&quot;. The idea about scalable architecture, performance optimization early in the game etc.</p>
<p>His thoughts on running a business in a competitive environment were interesting too.</p>

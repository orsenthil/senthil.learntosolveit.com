<p>This is a short non-technical book consisting of compiled speeches of Richard
Feynman. It does not into physics, but covers a lot of topics like religion,
politics, society, ethical questions in science, atom bombs and scientist
motivations. Richard feynman has lot of context to explore all these areas.
Plus, his communication style is very pleasant.</p>
<p>I usually avoid reading general books like this. But I happen to pick this up,
and on a day, when I was about to give some leeway into an astrology (it's not a
science) shared by my close ones, having just reading a topic in this book gave
me excellent points to bring my thinking back into track. Contrary to my
assumption when starting to read this book, I found it extremely useful!</p>

a individual working with his team, using his experience, build and sell a computer for education market.</p>
<p>Given the team he had, the approach he took, it seems that the result was a successful one.</p>
<p>BYTE in 1989 listed the NeXT Computer as among the &quot;Excellence&quot; winners of the
BYTE Awards, stating that it &quot;shows what can be done when a personal computer is
designed as a system, and not a collection of hardware elements&quot;. Citing as
&quot;truly innovative&quot; the optical drive, DSP, and object-oriented programming
environment, the magazine concluded that &quot;the NeXT Computer is worth every penny
of its $6500 market price&quot;.</p>

            NeXT Computer (also called the NeXT Computer System) is a workstation computer that was developed, marketed, and sold by NeXT Inc. It was introduced in October 1988 as the company's first and flagship product, at a price of US$6,500 (equivalent to $17,300 in 2024), aimed at the higher-education market. It was designed around the Motorola 68030 CPU and 68882 floating-point coprocessor, with a clock speed of 25 MHz. Its NeXTSTEP operating system is based on the Mach microkernel and BSD-derived Unix, with a proprietary GUI using a Display PostScript-based back end. According to the Science Museum Group, "The enclosure consists of a 1-foot (304.8 mm) die-cast magnesium cube-shaped black case, which led to the machine being informally referred to as 'The Cube'."

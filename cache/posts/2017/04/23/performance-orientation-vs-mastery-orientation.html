<p>On the topic of learning, it is widely recognized that &quot;mastery orientation&quot; is
more effective than &quot;performance orientation.&quot; Mastery orientation involves
doing something because you genuinely want to learn or improve, rather than to
prove your abilities to others. The focus is on personal growth and
self-improvement. This is the essence of mastery-based learning.</p>
<p>A memorable example of this concept can be found in the final dialogue from the movie <em>The Karate Kid</em>:</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Han:</strong> Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why? Why do you need to go back out there so badly?</p>
<p><strong>Dre Parker:</strong> Because I'm still scared. And no matter what happens tonight, when I leave, I don't want to be scared anymore.</p>

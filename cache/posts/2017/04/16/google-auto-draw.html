<p><a class="reference external" href="https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/autodraw">https://aiexperiments.withgoogle.com/autodraw</a>  - I really liked this experiment. You can doodle something and it will
pick your doodle and give you a proper picture.  For e.g. below I drew a flower and than could get a neat version.</p>
<p>If you are web-developer, no more struggling with creation for favicons. :) outsource it to AI.</p>

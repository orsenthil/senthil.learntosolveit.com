<p>It looks like children can learn multiple languages, and they can understand the structure of words used in language.
Today we visited an ice-cream shop, and after enjoying ice-cream, Siddhartha said:</p>
<p>Siddhartha: I like the ice-cream.</p>
<p>Shalini: Say it in Sourashtra:

            Saurashtra (Saurashtra script: ꢱꣃꢬꢵꢰ꣄ꢜ꣄ꢬ ꢩꢵꢰꢵ‎, Tamil script: சௌராட்டிர மொழி, Devanagari script: सौराष्ट्र भाषा) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken primarily by the Saurashtrians of Southern India who migrated from the Lata region of present-day Gujarat to south of Vindhyas in the Middle Ages.

<p>Siddhartha: <strong>Ice-cream love-ares.</strong></p>
<p>The way his mind seems to have worked is. He placed the Subject of the sentence first, as it is usually in Sourashtra.</p>
<p>He did not know the equivalent of &quot;like&quot; in Saurashtra. So, he used the English word &quot;love&quot; and added the suffix
&quot;ares&quot;, which means, &quot;being&quot;.</p>
<p>Correct translation should be: <strong>Ice-cream opa-ares.</strong></p>
<p>It's interesting how close he was in constructing a sentence by intuitively forming the grammar and creating words
using smaller parts.</p>
<p>I think, adults do this too.</p>

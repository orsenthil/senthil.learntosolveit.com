<p>Glyph Lefkowitz is a great author. In this post titled <a class="reference external" href="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html">unyielding</a> he makes an excellent case against threads, with so
many valid references for his arguments. He makes a point event driven programs that should be the first thing we
should think if we are think about concurrency.</p>
<p>As a developer or project lead, if I have to emulate certain practices for a writing high quality software, I think,
looking up to glyph and his twisted project is never a mistake.</p>

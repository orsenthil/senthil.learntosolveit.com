<h1>0.10</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>During the Gulf War in 1991, a U.S. Patriot missile failed to intercept an</p></li>
<li><p>Iraqi Scud missile, and 28 Americans were killed.</p></li>
<li><p>A later study determined that the problem was caused by the inaccuracy of the binary representation of 0.10.</p></li>
<li><p>The Patriot incremented a counter once every 0.10 seconds.</p></li>
<li><p>It multiplied the counter value by 0.10 to compute the actual time. However, the (24-bit) binary representation of 0.10 actually corresponds to 0.099999904632568359375, which is off by 0.000000095367431640625.</p></li>
<li><p>This doesn’t seem like much, but after 100 hours the time ends up being off by 0.34 seconds—enough time for a Scud to travel 500 meters!</p></li>
<li><p>Professor Skeel wrote a <a class="reference external" href="http://mate.uprh.edu/~pnegron/notas4061/patriot.htm">short article</a> about this.</p></li>

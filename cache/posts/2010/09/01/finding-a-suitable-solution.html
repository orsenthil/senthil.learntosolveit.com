            Cerebral palsy (CP) is a group of movement disorders that appear in early childhood. Signs and symptoms vary among people and over time, but include poor coordination, stiff muscles, weak muscles, and tremors. There may be problems with sensation, vision, hearing, and speech. Often, babies with cerebral palsy do not roll over, sit, crawl or walk as early as other children. Other symptoms may include seizures and problems with thinking or reasoning. While symptoms may get more noticeable over the first years of life, underlying problems do not worsen over time.

            Assistive technology (AT) is a term for assistive, adaptive, and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and the elderly. People with disabilities often have difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) independently, or even with assistance. ADLs are self-care activities that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, grooming, and personal device care. Assistive technology can ameliorate the effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks. For example, wheelchairs provide independent mobility for those who cannot walk, while assistive eating devices can enable people who cannot feed themselves to do so. Due to assistive technology,  people with disabilities have an opportunity of a more positive and easygoing lifestyle, with an increase in "social participation", "security and control", and a greater chance to "reduce institutional costs without significantly increasing household expenses." In schools, assistive technology can be critical in allowing students with disabilities to access the general education curriculum. Students who experience challenges writing or keyboarding, for example, can use voice recognition software instead. Assistive technologies assist people who are recovering from strokes and people who have sustained injuries that affect their daily tasks.

        </span> for a long
time and we have discovered a number of things with our trial and error
methods. It was quite clear to me that Assistive Technologies will be useful for
people like Avinash.</p>
<p>Just after meeting Avinash, I realized, a software called

            Dasher is an input method and computer accessibility tool which enables users to compose text without using a keyboard, by entering text on a screen with a pointing device such as a mouse, touch screen, or mice operated by the foot or head. Such instruments could serve as prosthetic devices for disabled people who cannot use standard keyboards, or where the use of one is impractical.

        </span> could be
useful to him. So, I went to his house and I remember we started with Dasher.
We did not know how to use it. I read and studied the documentation and it was
of no avail. I also realized the limitations of Avinash then. I saw that he was
able to move only his thumb and the index finger and he had a lot of
involuntary movements.  I tried different kinds of mouse which he can hold on
with his two fingers and my search for an Assistive technology device started
along the lines of finding a suitable mouse device for Avinash. It was four
years ago, that we also tried

Very few people were using Voice Recognition then and I had heard that it
requires considerable training to use the Voice Recognition. So I started with
the Voice Recognition training and I soon realized that the software was
demanding a certain accent and it was not able to recognize Avinash's style of
speaking. It led me to give up the thought on Voice Recognition itself.</p>

            Herbert George Wells (21 September 1866 – 13 August 1946) was an English writer, prolific in many genres. He wrote more than forty novels and dozens of short stories. His non-fiction output included works of social commentary, politics, history, popular science, satire, biography, and autobiography. Wells is most known today for his groundbreaking science fiction novels; he has sometimes been called the "father of science fiction", a title that has also been given to Jules Verne and Hugo Gernsback.

            The First Men in the Moon by the English author H. G. Wells is a scientific romance about a journey to the Moon by two Englishmen who discover that a sophisticated extraterrestrial civilisation of insect-like creatures ("Selenites") inhabits the lunar interior. The first-person narrator Mr. Bedford, a businessman, recounts his adventure with an eccentric scientist (Mr. Cavor), who has invented a gravity-blocking substance (cavorite) that the pair then use to construct a spherical spacecraft to reach the Moon, hoping to find valuable minerals. The work was originally serialised in The Strand Magazine (UK) and The Cosmopolitan (USA) from November 1900 to June 1901 and was published in hardcover book form in 1901. Wells called it one of his "fantastic stories".

<p>The Adobe Acrobat software also has a reader option where the software can read
the words aloud. However, it was not desirable as it was very mechanical and it
was not enjoyable for Avinash.</p>
<p>With the auto-scrolling feature, there still was a problem. It was not possible
for Avinash to take a break while reading as it would require manual
intervention to stop the computer from scrolling. So, Avinash had to be
constantly on his toes, so as to figuratively speak, to keep pace with the
automatic scrolling of the book.</p>
<p>We definitely needed a better solution with more control.</p>

<h2>Second Accessibility Device - Mobile phone</h2>
<p>One of the mobile phones in the market had a stick like pointer in the middle
and it was very suitable for Avinash. If someone placed that mobile in his
hands, he was able to control it with the stick interface. So, I got the idea
of connecting the mobile via

            Bluetooth is a short-range wireless technology standard that is used for exchanging data between fixed and mobile devices over short distances and building personal area networks (PANs). In the most widely used mode, transmission power is limited to 2.5 milliwatts, giving it a very short range of up to 10 metres (33 ft). It employs UHF radio waves in the ISM bands, from 2.402 GHz to 2.48 GHz. It is mainly used as an alternative to wired connections to exchange files between nearby portable devices and connect cell phones and music players with wireless headphones, wireless speakers, HIFI systems, car audio and wireless transmission between TVs and soundbars.

scrolling of the book can be controlled. But the mobile which I got was
slippery and also it required its cover to be removed in order to expose the
middle stick interface properly.</p>
<p>Tearing down a mobile just to use the pointer was something I daringly tried,
but proved, not effective.</p>
<p>We did try with controlling the cursor, but it was simply inefficient given the
limited control which Avinash could exercise on his mobile phone.</p>

<h2>Third Accessibility Device - A very small infra-red mouse</h2>
<p>Given that mobile phone was not suitable, I started looking out for a small

            Infrared (IR; sometimes called infrared light) is electromagnetic radiation (EMR) with wavelengths longer than that of visible light but shorter than microwaves. The infrared spectral band begins with the waves that are just longer than those of red light (the longest waves in the visible spectrum), so IR is invisible to the human eye. IR is generally (according to ISO, CIE) understood to include wavelengths from around 780 nm (380 THz) to 1 mm (300 GHz). IR is commonly divided between longer-wavelength thermal IR, emitted from terrestrial sources, and shorter-wavelength IR or near-IR, part of the solar spectrum. Longer IR wavelengths (30–100 μm) are sometimes included as part of the terahertz radiation band.  Almost all black-body radiation from objects near room temperature is in the IR band. As a form of EMR, IR carries energy and momentum, exerts radiation pressure, and has properties corresponding to both those of a wave and of a particle, the photon.

Staples store at Marathali, Bangalore. This was incidentally the first purchase,
specifically made for 'trying things out'.</p>
<p>I tried if we could control our original solution of Dasher with this
small-mouse in the way such that it could be used like a click device. I
studied Dasher again and saw that the whole operation can be controlled using a
single switch, but I did not find a way to interface that single switch to our
mouse.</p>
<p>So, I wrote to the dasher mailing list to seek help from experts. Dr. Julius
who is an expert in assistive technology suggested that I try out camera mouse,
which can recognize Avinash's face and thus he should be able to to control the
mouse movements with his head. This was an innovative suggestion, which we had
not tried in our earlier attempts.</p>

<p>The camera mouse solution was an interesting one. I setup the camera mouse that

the position of the mouse pointer could be controlled.</p>
<p>And to our surprise, we found that &quot;It worked!&quot;. He practised a lot with the

this down with great difficulty. There is a mistake in the sentence, and I left
it consciously, because it always believe, it is okay to make mistakes.</p>
<p>The camera mouse was not the solution yet. Due to involuntary movements, the
mouse pointer deviated frequently from the intended position. Julius suggested
to us that by gently nudging it back to the specific point this could be
controlled and he advised us to practise more. However, someone had to assist
Avinash in adjusting the camera-mouse settings properly and then load the
required software. Avinash could exhibit only a certain level of control from
this point onwards. It was a good improvement from where we started with, but it
still lacked something which we desired, namely the ease of use.</p>

<h2>Fifth Accessibility Technology - Voice Recognition</h2>
<p>Meanwhile in the Dasher mailing list, someone had mentioned that he was using
Voice Recognition in composing the mail and he uses Voice Recognition and
Dasher simultaneously. I approached him and he suggested that Voice Recognition
technology has improved a lot in the recent years and suggested that I try with
the latest version of

            The Speech Application Programming Interface or SAPI is an API developed by Microsoft to allow the use of speech recognition and speech synthesis within Windows applications. To date, a number of versions of the API have been released, which have shipped either as part of a Speech SDK or as part of the Windows OS itself. Applications that use SAPI include Microsoft Office, Microsoft Agent and Microsoft Speech Server.
            </span>
        </span>.</p>
<p>This required us to upgrade the speech recognition software in the operating
system. Once we did it, we tried the Voice Recognition training program
again. To our surprise, it worked very well for Avinash's voice and his accent
was not a problem like before. We were just enthralled. He quickly finished the
training and saw if he can use the voice recognition to control the computer by
voice. However, to our disappointment, it did not recognise the correct words
when Avinash was using the software. It was due to the way the software is
designed. It had a huge sample space to search and it did not identify what
Avinash was trying to say.</p>
<p>Then I set about to find a software which provides a limited voice recognition
capability, something like it could do only 10 tasks for the commands we
give. Given the limited and well defined set of tasks, the software may work
without any problems for Avinash.</p>
</section>
<section id="sixth-accessibility-technology-e-speaking-voice-recognition-software">
<h2>Sixth Accessibility Technology - e-Speaking Voice Recognition software</h2>
<p>Now, I did find a software that was meeting our exact needs. It was e-Speaking
Voice Recognition software. It used the System's voice recognition engine and
provided a limited set of commands to control the computer. It was readily
available for a nominal price. I purchased it and found that it was exactly what we
wanted at the moment.</p>
<p>Thus, Avinash could use the software effectively using speech. He could control
the scrolling of the adobe acrobat reader to read books, browse the folder to go
and get a new book, Connect to Internet and read news etc.</p>
<p>This was wonderful, it enhanced his ability to work independently on his
computer. With more practise he was only getting better and this proved to be a
convenient solution for Avinash. Just switch-on the computer with with these
software in the auto-start mode, if the microphone is attached to the computer,
then he could control it from that point onwards. No manual intervention
further required.</p>

<section id="seventh-accessibility-technology-writing-via-dasher-using-speech">
<h2>Seventh Accessibility Technology - Writing via Dasher using Speech</h2>
<p>A complete solution required combining the above individual elements. Avinash
had tried and succeeded using Dasher via head-mouse and then he could now
control his computer using e-Speaking voice recognition software. How about the
idea of combining both? Namely controlling the cursor of computer via speech. We
tried and it worked again. It was immensely helpful and satisfying. Avinash was
able to write on his computer using Dasher! This required more practise in
understanding the way Dasher works. Over time, he gained the ability to control
his computer and dasher together to write sentences effectively.</p>

speed can be increased significantly using Dasher, which would be as close to
the average speed of one among us.</p>

<section id="finally-something-useful">
<h2>Finally something useful</h2>
<p>This was a very good result. We both overjoyed with the outcome. Avinash's mom
was free from the task of flipping the pages for him. Avinash was able to
immerse himself in some creative pursuit for hours together on computer and
Internet and thus be engaged with some activity or the other. Both Avinash's
father and his brother, Sanjeev, are both happy with this new found capability
and the way he keeps himself engaged in his studies.</p>
<p>It was very nice to find a solution which was useful and effective.</p>
<p>For me, Senthil, I found that, I took on a very hard problem in relatable
space, dedicated myself to <strong>find a suitable solution</strong>. It was satisfying.
When someone suggest about &quot;scaling&quot; the solution, I say, solutions to

<pre class="literal-block">“Understanding what chimpanzees are like has made me realize that we humans are
not so different from other animals as we used to think. What makes us most
different is that we are far more clever than even the cleverest chimp, and we
have words. We have a spoken language. We can tell stories about what happened a
week or a year or a decade ago. We can plan for the future, and we can discuss
things - one person's idea can grow and change as other people contribute their
ideas. Great ideas become greater, problems are solved.”

- Jane Goodall, My Life with the Chimpanzees</pre>
<p>Jane Goodall shares her story for the rest of us. Her love for animals and nature
comes out through every word of this book. I was absolutely thrilled to read
this book. It is a wonderful book by a wonderful person.</p>

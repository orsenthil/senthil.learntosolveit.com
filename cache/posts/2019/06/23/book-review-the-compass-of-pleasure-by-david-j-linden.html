<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>This was a very good book.
It made me rethink about the pleasures of life in terms of chemicals, and its
properties on the human brain.
Everything we 'enjoy' is like a positive signal to a particular area in the
brain called VTA where Neuron's release dopamine to make us feel the pleasure.
Various experiments that humans have done, such as chemicals we eat (the taste
factor in food), drink, inhale, and physiological activities such as running,
exercise, sex, and brain activities like deep-thinking, understanding,
associative thinking, are all related and trigger those VTA neurons to give
pleasure.
The process of pleasures are understandable, and once we understand this, we
have better control over things around it, like society norms, and optimizing
for our desired outcome.
The book also touched upon the topic of addiction, which is commonly associated
with pleasure, but in reality, it is not.
The perspective shared in the book about addiction, was it should be treated as
a disease, like having a fever/cold/cough, and instead of feeling sorry or
ashamed, actions should involve just as we take actions to come out of
fever/cold and cough.</p>

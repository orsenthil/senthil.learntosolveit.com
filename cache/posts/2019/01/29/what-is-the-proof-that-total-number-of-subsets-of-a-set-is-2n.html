<p>I have known &quot;by heart&quot; that total number of the subsets of a set of n number is <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>
I was struggling to find an intuitive explanation, and two answers helped me to understand it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For each element, you have two choices: either you put it in your subset, or you don't; and these choices are all
independent.</p>

subsets of a set is $2^n$?, URL (version: 2013-10-31): <a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417">https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417</a></p>
<p>Another was this table that represented the sets as binary, to denote 0 as an absence of the element and 1 as presence
of the element.</p>
<p>That can help us understand that the total number of subsets of set of n is <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span></p>

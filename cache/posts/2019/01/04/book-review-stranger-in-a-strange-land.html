            Grok () is a neologism coined by the American writer Robert A. Heinlein for his 1961 science fiction novel Stranger in a Strange Land. While the Oxford English Dictionary summarizes the meaning of grok as "to understand intuitively or by empathy, to establish rapport with" and "to empathize or communicate sympathetically (with); also, to experience enjoyment", Heinlein's concept of a human who comes to Earth in early adulthood after being born on the planet Mars is far more nuanced, with critic Istvan Csicsery-Ronay Jr. observing that "the book's major theme can be seen as an extended definition of the term." The concept of grok garnered significant critical scrutiny in the years after the book's initial publication. The term and aspects of the underlying concept have become part of communities such as computer science.

people, which roughly means to &quot;understand thoroughly&quot; and becoming one with the
concept. I have used this phrase in Tamil &quot;கரைச்சி குடிச்சிட்டான்&quot; which means
someone thoroughly understood to subject at hand.</p>
<p>One interesting thing about this science fiction is, it combined the real world
concepts of business, stocks, politics, and ownership with an imaginary
situation where humans have already traveled to Mars and there is a human raised
by Martians among us. The details covering the rise of Mike to the status of a
godman, and formation of his communion was a fun read.</p>
<p>Just imagine how close is this quote &quot;Thou art god, I am god. All that groks is
god.” by Valentine Michael Smith to the Sanskrit Verse

            The Mahāvākyas (sing.: mahāvākyam, महावाक्यम्; plural: mahāvākyāni, महावाक्यानि) are "The Great Sayings" of the Upanishads, with mahā meaning great and vākya, a sentence. The Mahāvākyas are traditionally considered to be four in number, though actually five are prominent in the post-Vedic literature:

            Solipsism (  SOLL-ip-siz-əm; from Latin  solus 'alone' and  ipse 'self') is the philosophical idea that only one's mind is sure to exist. As an epistemological position, solipsism holds that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure; the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind.

            Pantheism refers to a diverse family of philosophical and religious beliefs, that equate reality with divinity. Pantheistic concepts date back thousands of years, and pantheistic elements have been identified in diverse religious traditions. Most notably, pantheism refers to the belief that the totality of being—called by various names Nature, universe, cosmos—is a self-organizing unity that needs no distinct creator, and can be met with the same sense of reveration and awe as theists attribute to their gods.

            Robert Anson Heinlein ( HYNE-lyne; July 7, 1907 – May 8, 1988) was an American science fiction author, aeronautical engineer, and naval officer. Sometimes called the "dean of science fiction writers", he was among the first to emphasize scientific accuracy in his fiction and was thus a pioneer of the subgenre of hard science fiction. His published works, both fiction and non-fiction, express admiration for competence and emphasize the value of critical thinking. His plots often presented provocative situations which challenged conventional social mores. His work continues to have an influence on the science-fiction genre and on modern culture more generally.

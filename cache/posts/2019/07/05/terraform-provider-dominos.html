<p>I ordered Pizza using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.terraform.io/">terraform</a> today. I was learning about terraform and how provider can be anything,
even Software as a Service, which is basically an API.</p>
<p>So, it made possible to develop software like <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ndmckinley/terraform-provider-dominos">terraform-provider-dominos</a> using which you can order Pizza.
I tried it. The terraform apply crashed for me, but I knew that terraform might have attempted the purchase operation
and had probably crashed due to slow response from the API. It was the case. I saw my credit card charged in my account, an order confirmation email, and in 30 minutes, I got my pizza.</p>

<p>I tried this <a class="reference external" href="https://codeforces.com/contest/1189/problem/A">codeforces problem contest/1189/problem/A</a>. Trying a contest problem after many years and I thought,
it was a problem either with Dynamic Programming or with Recursion.</p>
<p>Turned out be a much much simpler one, that if a person reads the problem carefully and understands the scope of the solution,
the solution can be written in &lt; 2 minutes.</p>
<p>I spent 30 minutes unsuccessfully. Lack of experience shows up if you don't practice.</p>

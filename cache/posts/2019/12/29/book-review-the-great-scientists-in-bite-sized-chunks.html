<p>My rating: 5 of 5 stars</p>
<p>A simple book gives an overview of many scientists and explains their
achievements within a page.
The book is divided into categories such as Astronomy, Physics, Biology,
Environment, etc, and goes from the earliest changemaker in this field to the
latest.
It is very easy to see how each of the scientists stood on top of the research
done by the previous one, sometimes in a different field.
The personal characteristics and the challenges faced by these scientists in
their respective eras were entertaining to read.
In terms of personal characteristics, Roentgen, after discovering X-rays, had
refused to benefit financially from his discovery believing that it should be
freely available to all.
I wanted to note down Rudolf Virchow's view, wherein he believes: &quot;Medicine is a
social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale&quot;.</p>

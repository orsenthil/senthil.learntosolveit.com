<p>I did not clear the exam in the first attempt, came close to clearing in the second attempt, did a horrible docker mistake in my third attempt.
In my third attempt I ran a sleep 3600 when with <cite>-it</cite> flag flag on for docker run, and I could not exit or kill the shell.</p>
<p>Finally, cleared the exam in my fourth attempt. It is fun a exam for someone interested in Kubernetes to take.</p>

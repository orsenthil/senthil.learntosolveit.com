<p>Excellent article on History and Concept of the programming language Lisp was
published at this site called twobithistory</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html">https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html</a></p>
<p>Author goes in into the details on History of Lisp, the motivation behind the
design, how the language, and an early book "SICP" created a culture of
veneration for that language.</p>
<p>He also credits Paul Graham, and XKCD comics to have significantly surged the
interest back in lisp.</p>
<p>Interesting anecdotes like how braces end up being chosen for the language. The
motivation of the SICP book was very noble.</p>

<p>I have three projects that are focused on technical writing, note taking and documentation of computer science concepts.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.learntosolveit.com/">http://www.learntosolveit.com/</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coursedocs.org/">http://www.coursedocs.org/</a></li>
<li>And my blog <a class="reference external" href="http://xtoinfinity.com/">http://xtoinfinity.com/</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I feel like these projects could be consolidated, merged into a single domain. I am thinking of merging</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.learntosolveit.com/">http://www.learntosolveit.com/</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.coursedocs.org/">http://www.coursedocs.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>and calling it learntosolveit.com</p>
<p>And I am thinking of hosting <a class="reference external" href="http://xtoinfinity.com/">http://xtoinfinity.com/</a> at <cite>senthil.learntosolveit.com</cite> setup the appropriate domain
redirections.</p>
<p>Since these are writing projects, keeping them consolidated seem to make sense to me. Still wondering what the
dis-advantages of this will be.</p>

<p>To prepare for my next course with Introduction to Operating Systems I had to brush up my knowledge of C and C++.</p>
<p>I studied and worked through</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/">Essential C</a></li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/">Pointers and Memory</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I found a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwLZp6LMUKI3cc7pgGsasm2_">video series on Pointers in C</a>, by mycodeschool that helped clarify a lot of concepts with Pointers in C.
It started making me feel comfortable again. It is amazing to have resources like these when we are learning
difficult concepts today.</p>

Agatha Christie won the bet my with my reading of the book too. I could not figure out the murderer or figure out the plot. It may be hard or impossible for the reader to find the plot as the information that is shared with is limited and more information is revealed as the plot is disclosed.<br><br>It was an enjoyable book with the variety of characters and it took me a to mid-century England for the hours I was reading this book.</span>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2482522880">4 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
I loved this book. This is a very short book, to the point, and explains the universe in simple terms. What I didn't expect and was a surprise to me was the Author's humorous anecdotes, completely relevant to the present day reader inserted between the concepts in the pages.<br><br>For e.g. It was funny to know that behind US Govt which consumes Helium for military and research, the next second highest consumer of "Helium" was Macy's for it's Macy's day parade.<br><br>It was startling to know that life as we understand in any form, the single-celled organism has started in existence only the last 2% of the history of the universe. The universe is very very old, very very big. <br><br>Often there is a question on "Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" - The more I read these kinds of books, the more I realize that "There is life elsewhere in the universe. Highly likely. It is inevitable that either Earthians discover the other life forms, and they discover the Earthians. Also, the timeline of advancement, the calamities that are possible in next thousand years, humankind will, of course, take the ship, explore, and start settling in various other parts of the universe. Thinking like this doesn't sound like fiction to me.<br><br>It was a great book. I will start looking out for Neil DeGrasse Tyson from now.<p>Here are some excerpts that I noted from the book. This one is about Einstein, and the kind of impact he had in our
understanding of the universe.</p>

<p>In any decision making, being right, getting things right seems intimidating. For human decisions, being right is
debatable too. Being less wrong appears desirable and achievable. If a person is committed to non-perfectionist
philosophy, then being less wrong falls right into his stride.</p>
<p>I stumbled upon the phrase Less Wrong from the blog lesswrong.com. In the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TNHQLZK5pHbxdnz4e/references-and-resources-for-lesswrong">FAQ</a>
section I discovered some insight into what tries to achieve.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
... even smart people can be completely wrong but that most people are not even wrong.
It teaches you to be careful in what you emit and to be skeptical of what you receive.
It doesn't tell you what is right, it teaches you how to think and to become less wrong.
And to do so is in your own self interest ...

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2454475203">5 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
This book is written by my parents, so my obvious bias there. It chooses many good Sourashtra Recipes and presents them. The presentation is good. The language, editing can be improved.
<br><br><p>The book in various different formats is available here:</p>

                    <p>I had a random thought when observing a social conflict. I think, people who have self-control or exercise restraint
garner more respect than people who people argue, however logical, in social situations.</p>

<p>I have been involved with Spastics Society Of Karnataka for more than 10 years. Today, we launched a new website
for the organization. Please check this out <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a></p>
<div class="section" id="a-bit-of-history">
<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>Let's use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine">wayback machine</a> to look at how this evolved.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When I inherited this project, the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040521200831/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">website looked like this in 2004</a>. I don't remember the technology, but it was
done by a volunteer by name Mr. Nagaraj. He transfered the hosting and domain from  Net 4 India to us.</li>
<li>Then sometime <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523104054/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">in 2007 the website started looking like this</a> - I don't remember the technology that I used. It seems
I was using <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523172324/http://www.oswd.org:80/">open source web design</a>  and looks like I hand-coded it.</li>
<li>In 2008, we moved entirely to <a class="reference external" href="https://edu.google.com/k-12-solutions/g-suite/?modal_active=none">Google Apps for Education</a> - this was a great move. It facilitated online
processing, official email ids, all our data in a single place. This was like migrating Spastics Society of Karnataka
to the "Cloud". The website changed its <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">look to this in 2008</a> using google sites.</li>
<li>The google sites website was not very pleasant looking. <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160721031435/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org:80/">This time in 2013, I updated website to wordpress</a>, and
hosted on bluehost.com and our domains were migrated to Google Domains. The wordpress website also had
accessibility features on changing font, style etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was problem, wordpress is not the most secure of the software that is present today. We got <a class="reference external" href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/webmasters/YayR1-iZ3x0/73Ig3qiWEQAJ">hacked by chinese hackers</a> who put up malware in our site.
This wasn't good. I removed the phishing, and they could still get to us. This happened for 2 months and I felt a
lack of control with wordpress.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We decided to shutdown and <strong>delete</strong> the wordpress site, and decided to rebuild it. For stop-gap, we directed
people to <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">Google Sites website</a>
</li>
<li>This stop gap solution lasted for more than a year because I did not want to rebuild it entirely with wordpress again.</li>
<li>In 2016, I decided to hand-code it using <a class="reference external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://orsenthil.github.io/sskweb/">built this</a> - This was hugely unappealing. It
was <strong>extremely secure and trustworthy</strong>, but felt very unappealing to everyone.</li>
<li>In 2018, we decided to make a appealing website, and this time I went with a hosted service, wix.com. The result is
what you see at <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This was a team effort. My friends Avinash and Nivedita got involved. We use Trello.com to track our tasks. From
school Preethi, and Priya  Madam and Sobha Madam got involved too. The website does not have <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus-factor</a> of 1 and
this is an incredible feature.</p>
<p>The website was mostly done by Avinash. He cannot use his hands, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEwO17xd4eU">uses voice to operate his computer</a> So this
website was created using voice.</p>
<p>Simple theme, accessible on mobile and our google apps (cloud) still remain for forms, email and everything as it
is convenient to manage.</p>
<p>I believe this change is going to help school further. Given what I have shared above, this project is a living
entity, and will evolve with times.</p>

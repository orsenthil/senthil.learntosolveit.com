<html><body><p>This is  wonderful thought by Dr. Kalam and it appears in his poem, "Song of Youth" in the book <a title="Ignited Minds" href="http://books.google.com.sg/books?id=kypuAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Ignited+Minds" target="_blank">Ignited Minds</a>.



The poem goes like this and is written for students to work hard for the development of country.  This phrase in this "<strong>Small aim is a crime</strong>" is a catchy one and applicable to any field. Wonderful thought and a life lesson.

</p><blockquote>

<div align="center">As a young citizen of India, armed with technology,</div>

<div align="center">knowledge and love for my nation, I realize, small aim is a crime.</div>

<div align="center">I will work and sweat for a great vision, the vision of transforming India</div>

<div align="center">into a developed nation, powered by economic strength with value system.

I am one of the citizens of the billion; Only the vision will ignite the billion souls.

It has entered into me ;</div>

<div align="center">The ignited soul compared to any resource is the most powerful resource on the earth,</div>

<div align="center">above the earth and under the earth.

I will keep the lamp of knowledge burning to achieve the vision - Developed India

If we work and sweat for the great vision with ignited minds,</div>

<div align="center">the transformation leading to the birth of vibrant developed India will happen.

I pray the Almighty:</div>

<div align="center">"May the divine peace with beauty enter into our people;</div>

<div align="center">Happiness and good health blossom in our bodies, minds and souls".</div></blockquote>

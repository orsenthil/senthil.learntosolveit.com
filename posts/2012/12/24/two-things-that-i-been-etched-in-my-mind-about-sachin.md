As soon as he got out, India fell short of 17 runs from victory. To me, victory does not count anything, but this attempt of a person carrying the team, overcoming personal physical pain and going for it was an enormous gesture.



Sachin returned to his work, i.e. playing cricket and scoring a century against Kenya in a world cup, one day after his father died says millions about work ethic, concentration and love for something. His family appreciated him for that.</p></body></html>

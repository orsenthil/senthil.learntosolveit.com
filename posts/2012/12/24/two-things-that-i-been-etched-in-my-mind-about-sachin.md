<html><body><p>Sachin's score 138 against Pakistan in a late nighties tour. He was fighting a severe back ache and then hitting the pakistan bowlers all over the ground. As soon as he got out, India fell short of 17 runs from victory. To me, victory does not count anything, but this attempt of a person carrying the team, overcoming personal physical pain and going for it was an enormous gesture.



Sachin returned to his work, i.e. playing cricket and scoring a century against Kenya in a world cup, one day after his father died says millions about work ethic, concentration and love for something. His family appreciated him for that.</p></body></html>

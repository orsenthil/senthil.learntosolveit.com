_I like this way of thinking._

**Math problems aren’t solved, they are conquered!**

Well, this problem below was one that I had to defeat.  I went to battle with it
and after losing a few skirmishes (i.e., trying approaches that failed) I
finally beat it into submission.  From now on, when I see that feisty integral
that won’t behave or a simple number puzzle whose pattern defies identification,
I’ll strap on my armor (or sweater vest), grab my sword (or calculator) and wage
full-out war on that problem.  No problem is safe!

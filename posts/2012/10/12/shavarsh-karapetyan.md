Karapetyan had just completed his usual distance of 20 km (12 mi) when he heard
the sound of the crash and saw the sinking trolleybus which had gone out of
control and fallen from the dam wall.</p><p>The trolleybus lay at the bottom of
the reservoir some 25 metres (80 ft) offshore at a depth of 10 metres (33 ft).
Karapetyan swam to it and, despite conditions of almost zero visibility, due to
the silt rising from the bottom, broke the back window with his legs. The
trolleybus was crowded, it carried 92 passengers and Karapetyan knew he had
little time, spending some 30 to 35 seconds for each person he
saved.</p><p>Karapetyan managed to rescue 20 people (he picked up more, but only
20 survived), but this ended his sports career: the combined effect of cold
water and the multiple wounds he received (scratched by glass), left him
unconscious for 45 days. Subsequent sepsis, due to the presence of raw sewage in
the lake water, and lung complications prevented him from continuing his sports
career.</p><p>On February 19th, 1985, Shavarsh just happened to be near a
burning building, that had people trapped inside. He rushed in and started
pulling people out without a second thought. Once again, he was badly hurt
(severe burns) and spent a long time in the hospital.</p><p>

He later moved to Moscow and founded a shoe company called "Second Breath". Karapetyan was later awarded a UNESCO "Fair Player" medal for his heroism.</p><p>A {{% wikipedia article="Main_belt" text="main belt" %}} {{% wikipedia article="Asteroid" text="asteroid" %}}, {{% wikipedia article="3027_Shavarsh" text="3027 Shavarsh" %}}, discovered by {{% wikipedia article="Nikolai_Chernykh" text="Nikolai Chernykh" %}}, was named after him (approved by the {{% wikipedia article="Minor_Planet_Center" text="MPC" %}} in September 1986).

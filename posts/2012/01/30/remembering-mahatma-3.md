<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:x-small;">"I will give you a talisman. Whenever you are in doubt, or when the self becomes too much with you, apply the following test. Recall the face of the poorest and the weakest man whom you may have seen, and ask yourself, if the step you contemplate is going to be of any use to him. Will he gain anything by it? Will it restore him to a control over his  own life and destiny? In other words, will it lead to swaraj for the hungry and spiritually starving millions? Then you will find your doubts and your self melt away."</span></p>

<p align="justify"><span style="font-family:Verdana;font-size:x-small;"> - One of the last notes left behind by Gandhi in 1948, expressing his deepest social thought.</span></p>

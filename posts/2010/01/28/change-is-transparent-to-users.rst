.. description: A discussion about what it means when a change is described as "transparent to users" in software development.

phoe6: When something is said "the change is largely {{% wikipedia article="Transparency (behavior)" %}} to the users".

I can understand that users will be able to see through, but does it also mean,
the users won't be affected by the change? 

Zemblan said: It means they probably wont notice.

Shamcas: They probably won't notice.

phoe6: that seems true, but I don't get the logic of how something being
transparent means this.

Shamcas: they don't see it. :P

ViciousPotato: phoe6: If something is {{% wikipedia article="Transparency (optics)" %}}, you can see through it.

ViciousPotato: Thus, a transparent change would be something a user would
likely look right past.

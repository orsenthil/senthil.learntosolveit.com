<html><body><p>phoe6: When something is said "the change is largely transparent to the users".

I can understand that users will be able to see through, but does it also mean,

the users won't be affected by the change? 



Zemblan said: It means they probably wont notice.



Shamcas: They probably won't notice.



phoe6: that seems true, but I don't get the logic of how something being

transparent means this.



Shamcas: they don't see it. :P



ViciousPotato: phoe6: If something is transparent, you can see through it.

ViciousPotato: Thus, a transparent change would be something a user would

likely look right past.</p></body></html>

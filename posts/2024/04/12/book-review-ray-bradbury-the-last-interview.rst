This book is a collection of interviews by Ray Bradbury's biographer, Sam
Weller.

Sam presents a glimpse into the final years of Ray Bradbury's life, which in
itself is moving. It took a moment for me to realize the depravity of life
during the old age, even as we constantly associate Ray Bradbury with his work
on Fahrenheit 451, which he had written multiple years ago. This was the
poignant part of the entire book for me, and it shook me a bit.

But despite this, the book is hip and is full of love. It is about the love
that Ray Bradbury shared for books, authors and his craft. He encouraged
everyone to follow *their path of love* and to true to themselves.

I got a glimpse into why Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451, and how did he
shape his characters.  I haven't read Fahrenheit 451, but I had watched the
movie and listened to the short version called blink of that book. It seems
funny in retrospect that I had approached Fahrenheit 451 in these media, and not
read it. But I will certainly read it and appreciate it even more now.

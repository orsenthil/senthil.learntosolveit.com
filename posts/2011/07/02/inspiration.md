<blockquote><em>Inspiration is not the exclusive privilege of poets or artists. There is, there has been, there will always be a certain group of people whom</em> <em>inspiration visits. It's made up of all those who've consciously chosen their calling and do their job with love and imagination. It may</em> <em>include doctors, teachers, gardeners — I could list a hundred more professions. Their work becomes one continuous adventure as long as</em> <em>they manage to keep discovering new challenges in it. Difficulties and setbacks never quell their curiosity. A swarm of new questions emerges from every problem that they solve. Whatever inspiration is, it's born from a continuous "I don't know."</em>

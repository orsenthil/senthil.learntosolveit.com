<html><body><p>Try! Yoda's philosophy ("There is no `try'") sounds neat, but it doesn't work for me. I have done most of my work while anxious about whether I could do the job, and unsure that it would be enough to achieve the goal if I did. But I tried anyway, because there was no one but me between the enemy and my city. Surprising myself, I have sometimes succeeded. Sometimes I failed; some of my cities have fallen. Then I found another threatened city, and got ready for another battle.

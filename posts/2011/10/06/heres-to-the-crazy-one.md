<html><body><p>Here’s to the crazy one.The misfit.The rebel.The troublemaker.The round peg in the square holes. The one who saw things differently. He was not fond of rules. And he had no respect for the status quo. You can quote him, disagree with him, glorify or vilify him. About the only thing you can’t do is ignore him. Because he changed things. He invented.He imagined.He healed.He explored . He created. He inspired. He pushed the human race forward. Maybe he had to be crazy. How else can you stare at an empty canvas and see a work of art? Or sit in silence and hear a song that’s never been written? Or gaze at a red planet and see a laboratory on wheels? He made tools for for people. While some see him as a crazy one, everyone saw him as a genius. Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do.

*My Rating: 4/5*

There is a decent chance that you must have heard about this movie. I had heard the
name too, had a vague idea from reading synopsis what I would expect.  But I was
totally wrong. After a point, I said to myself, it is no longer good vs. evil story.

It has a very thin storyline but has an excellent performance
from the villain, gripping scenes that will keep you absorbed.

I won't the read book, but I enjoyed watching the movie.

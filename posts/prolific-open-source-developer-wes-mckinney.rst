The name `Wes McKinney`_ rang a bell when I was reading a general news article on a hedge-fund developer
talking about open source developer stresses. Then I realized that the created of `Pandas library`_,  author
of the book `Python for Data Analysis`_  was working for 2-Sigma now. I also came to know that he is a
committer with `Apache Parquet`_ project, which is a C++ library for storing data in a columnar fashion.
With all these noteworthy implementations aside, Wes seems to have a background in statistics from MIT.

There are many interesting people whose work we use, sometimes unaware of the person behind the project.

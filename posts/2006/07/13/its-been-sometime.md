.. description: Reflections on late-night work, Python learning, and project management.

It's been some time since I worked until 04:20:28. I had some discussions with
friends, completed my work, and handled project management tasks as well. Python
is catching up wellâ€”it's really a cool language. Once I become sufficiently
familiar with it, writing Python should feel like writing English.

### Questions to myself:
- Find the difference between `re.search` and `re.match`.
- Read the Python FAQ.

### Recent Books

- **Comics: Tintin: Destination Moon and Explorers on the Moon**
    A good entertainer. I am a long-time fan of Tintin.

- **The Mythical Man Month**
    Excellent essays on software engineering by Fred Brooks. His experience managing a large software project is evident in this book.
    The book provides valuable insights into the software development process. If you are a software developer, tester, or manager, you should read this book.

- **The Code Book by Simon Singh**
    This book explores the history of cryptography and shares many stories from the field. It sparks interest in cryptography and helps you appreciate the efforts of those who have contributed to its development.

### Recent Movies

- **Munich**
    It was okay. You can watch it once. It felt like a standard Spielberg movie.

- **The Incredibles**
    Excellent movie. I don't know why I missed watching this in the theater. I enjoyed it a lot. Dash's run was particularly impressive.

- **Ice Age 2**
    I watched it twice. I enjoyed it very much the first time. The scenery is well-made, and the storyline is okay, but still very enjoyable.

- **The Da Vinci Code**
    A good movie. I initially wanted to watch it after reading the book but decided to watch it anyway. I found it very interesting.
    The movie is gripping even if you know the story. It presents an alternative history suggesting that Jesus was married to Mary Magdalene, they had a child, and their lineage continues to this day.

That's all I can remember for the recent past.

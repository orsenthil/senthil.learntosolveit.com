I was trying to post entries directly from Vim, but the text is not displaying
properly. I need to figure out the problem and fix it. It's been pending for
some days now. Once it's resolved, it will be so comfortable to post to
LiveJournal directly from Vim.

## Reviews

I watched **The Departed**, and I liked it. It's a very good movie with a good
story and excellent direction. It might keep you on the edge of your seat while
watching. The actors Matt Damon, Leonardo DiCaprio, and others have done an
outstanding job. Well, you're going to hear the 'F' word at least 100 times in
that movie, but you won't mind it. The movie is a kind of chase where a rat is
implanted on both sides (a gang and the police), and they try to find out who
the rat is, while both rats are very clever.

## FOSS.IN

Visited FOSS.IN today. Well, I was a bit disappointed as the quality of talks
seems to be going down. A few were goodâ€”I enjoyed
[bluesmoon's](http://bluesmoon.livejournal.com/) talk, and the intro by Suparna
was okay. But the rest were disappointing!

Atul Chitnis, if I were you, I would just pick quality speakers and fit only as
many as the schedule allows (one day or two days). I would not compromise
quality in favor of "let's do grand" things. But hey, you're doing a fantastic
job (a few quality talks spread over three days) for the minor amount you're
collecting from the delegates.

Kudos, keep going, but please check for quality now and then.

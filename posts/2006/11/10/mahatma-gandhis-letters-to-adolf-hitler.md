.. description: An exploration of Mahatma Gandhi's letters to Adolf Hitler, emphasizing non-violence and universal friendship during a tumultuous historical period.

I had heard from my friend Ashok that Mahatma Gandhi wrote a letter to Adolf
Hitler, asking him to stop the war and teaching him about Ahimsa. I stumbled
upon a link discussing that letter in the Wikipedia article on [Mahatma
Gandhi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi).

Here is an article that discusses [Gandhi's letters to Hitler](http://koenraadelst.bharatvani.org/articles/fascism/gandhihitler.html).
We learn that Gandhi addressed Hitler as his friend and emphasized that it was
not just words—he truly believed in universal friendship and extended it to
Hitler as well. This was during a time when Hitler was suggesting to the British
that killing Gandhi would suppress the Indian rebellion.

The article discusses various political instances where Gandhi's ideologies
could have been applied. One can notice that the author gives a favorable
treatment of Gandhi's ideologies in these situations. The last paragraph of the
article was particularly impressive.

To quote from the article itself:

> It is not certain that this would have worked, but then Gandhism is not
synonymous with effectiveness. Gandhi’s methods were successful in dissuading
the British from holding on to India, not in dissuading the Muslim League from
partitioning India. From that angle, it simply remains an open question, an
untried experiment, whether the Gandhian approach could have succeeded in
preventing World War 2. By contrast, there simply cannot be two opinions on
whether that approach of non-violent dissuasion would have been Gandhian. The
Mahatma would not have been the Mahatma if he had preferred any other method.
Our judgment of his letters to Hitler must be the same as our judgment of
Gandhism itself: either both represented a lofty ethical alternative to the more
common methods of power politics, or both were erroneous and ridiculous.

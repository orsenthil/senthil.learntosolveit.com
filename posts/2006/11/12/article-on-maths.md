[Maths for Programmers](http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html).

That article is very insightful. It analyzes how mathematics can be useful to
any programmer at any time.

We have all lost touch with basic mathematics and need to gear up. His
suggestion is that mathematics should be learned breadth-first and not
depth-first. By knowing different mathematical solutions, we can identify which
section a problem belongs to and approach it correctly.

Another suggestion for all of us is to start with any math section on Wikipedia,
follow it until we understand it, and make it a daily habit.

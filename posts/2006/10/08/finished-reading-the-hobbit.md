<html><body><p>Finished reading "The Hobbit" today and subsequently became a fan of J.R.R Tolkein. It was my first J.R.R Tolkein reader, I had purchased it in 2005 and started reading it few months ago. After breaks, I had time to finish it up today. JRR Tolkein's English is superb! Now, I understand why so many fans are there worldwide. It captures your imagination and takes you the Hobbit world. The description of events is very good and creates an interest in the reader.

Recommended reading for anyone who has not yet read JRR Tolkein.</p></body></html>

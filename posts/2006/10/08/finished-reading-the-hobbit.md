.. description: Reflections on finishing "The Hobbit" and becoming a fan of J.R.R. Tolkien.

Finished reading *The Hobbit* today and subsequently became a fan of J.R.R.
Tolkien. It was my first J.R.R. Tolkien book. I had purchased it in 2005 and
started reading it a few months ago. After some breaks, I finally had time to
finish it today.

Tolkien's English is superb! Now, I understand why he has so many fans
worldwide. The book captures your imagination and transports you to the world of
hobbits. The descriptions of events are vivid and engaging, creating a strong
interest in the reader.

**Recommended reading** for anyone who has not yet explored J.R.R. Tolkien's works.

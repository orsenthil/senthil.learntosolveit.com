.. description: Using viper-mode to enable vim-like editing capabilities in Emacs

This is a emacs, viper mode. If vim fans are threathened and forced to user emacs, then they might find this M-x viper-mode as a consolation somewhat akin to a family photo a prisoner has in jail. He will be missing his family for sure though.

.. description: Reflections on my second year of learning Karate and the journey ahead.

As I had recorded in [my old blog](http://orsenthil.blogspot.com/2005/03/kihon-kumite-kata-hosu.html), I
started learning {{% wikipedia article="Karate" %}}, two years ago
starting 22nd of March. While I am enjoying everybit of it, I have lot of ground
to cover.

The three main components of karate training are {{% wikipedia article="Kihon" %}}, {{% wikipedia article="Kumite" %}}, and {{% wikipedia article="Kata" %}}.

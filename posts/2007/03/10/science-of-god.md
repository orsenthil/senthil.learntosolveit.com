.. description: Exploring scientific theories about why humans are genetically predisposed to believe in God and how religious foundation has been essential for societies throughout history.

Some time back, there was a story in {{% wikipedia article="Slashdot" %}} science section which dealt with
"Human beings believing in God was necessary for adaptation, survival and
reproduction". This was a study of genetic theory about how humans came to
believe in God. One of the scientists got curious at the fact (which surprised
me too) that **"started looking at history, and I wondered why no society ever
survived more than three generations without a religious foundation as its
raison d'Ãªtre."**

The article details that humans are [hardwired to believe in god](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/magazine/04evolution.t.html?pagewanted=1&ei=5088&en=a43cfb7b24423cc6&ex=1330664400&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss),
it has supported the survival of the race and various different theories of
existence and normal human understanding. It also gives account of how {{% wikipedia article="Atheism" text="atheists" %}}
view the fact and they have to work hard to get the details rather than just
leaving it unexplained.

The [slashdot story](http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/03/04/1925246) as usual was interesting.

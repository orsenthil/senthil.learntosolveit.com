<html><body><p>I submitted my <a href="http://puggy.symonds.net/~senthil/summer_code_urllib.txt">proposal on clean up urllib</a> in python to PSF. Was read the mails in the list and interacting with few mentors and found that folks are very helpful. 

It kind of amazes me to know about these wonderful developers. It will be very inspiring indeed to work along with them ( be it SoC or not).</p></body></html>

[vimplugin for Eclipse](http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/)

- Install it using the Eclipse plugin installer and point it to: [http://vimplugin.sf.net/update](http://vimplugin.sf.net/update)
- In Window Preferences, locate the vimplugin settings and set the path to your Vim installation (not gVim). (Note: This might not work immediatelyâ€”ensure you also configure General > Editor > File Associations for the file types you wish to open with Vim.)
- Open a file and click to focus on it. (I found this workaround in the known issues.)

Re: VIM Sucks



shortly thereafter, VIM returned carrying a shotgun and wearing steel-toed boots. VIM shot emacs in the chest and then kicked Emacs in the head and in the groin.  Emacs never was the same again.  To this day, Emacs plays with his toy towers of Hanoi puzzle and always has a psychiatrist around in case he feels scared.

Re: VIM Sucks



Not really.vim is a useful editor when u know _how_ to use it. So is emacs.

i once went to a bar. the night was young. the crowd was crazy. the air was electric. and then it happened. emacs kicked vim's ass and threw him on floor. vim 'whim'pered and ran away in shame.

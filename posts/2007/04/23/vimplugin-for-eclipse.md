[vimplugin for Eclipse](http://vimplugin.sourceforge.net/)

- Install it using the Eclipse plugin installer and point it to: [http://vimplugin.sf.net/update](http://vimplugin.sf.net/update)
- In Window Preferences, locate the vimplugin settings and set the path to your Vim installation (not gVim). (Note: This might not work immediatelyâ€”ensure you also configure General > Editor > File Associations for the file types you wish to open with Vim.)
- Open a file and click to focus on it. (I found this workaround in the known issues.)

<ul>

<li> Install it using the eclipse plugin installer, pointing the location to <a href="http://vimplugin.sf.net/update">http://vimplugin.sf.net/update</a>

</li><li> In the Window Preferences, the vimplugin preferences should be available. Point the vimplugin to your vim install location (not gvim). Did not work for me. Set the General | Editor | File associations preferences also  the kind of files you wish to open in vim. 

</li><li> Open the file, and focus on it using the mouse to use it. ( Yeah, I found this in the known issues)

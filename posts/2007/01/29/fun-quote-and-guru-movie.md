.. description: A reflection on watching the movie Guru for the second time and appreciating the philosophical arguments about capitalism.

*I'd crawl over an acre of 'Visual This++' and 'Integrated Development That' to
*get to gcc, Emacs, and gdb. Thank you.*

I watched *Guru* for the second time. Believe me, the movie was a lot better the
second time, and its point about capitalism was more convincing than before,
especially when one already knows what the movie is about. On the second
viewing, thoughts of Dhirubhai Ambani or Bill Gates did not come to mind, while
the rationale behind the arguments and thoughts of Gurubhai stood out more
prominently.

plz don't make bill-g the icon of capitalism. he is hated for his slimy, unhackerly, unethical behavior. the same crowd doesn't hate larry &amp; sergey.



bill became rich coz ibm was stupid. not coz he "created wealth" of that magnitude.



i am all for capitalism. 'atlas shrugged' (ayn rand) is my fav. bill is just a negative example.

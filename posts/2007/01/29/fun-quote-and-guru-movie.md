.. description: A reflection on watching the movie Guru for the second time and appreciating the philosophical arguments about capitalism.

*I'd crawl over an acre of 'Visual This++' and 'Integrated Development That' to
*get to {{% wikipedia article="GNU Compiler Collection" text="gcc" %}}, {{% wikipedia article="Emacs" %}}, and {{% wikipedia article="GNU Debugger" text="gdb" %}}. Thank you.*

I watched *{{% wikipedia article="Guru (2007 film)" %}}* for the second time. Believe me, the movie was a lot better the
second time, and its point about capitalism was more convincing than before,
especially when one already knows what the movie is about. On the second
viewing, thoughts of {{% wikipedia article="Dhirubhai Ambani" %}} or {{% wikipedia article="Bill Gates" %}} did not come to mind, while
the rationale behind the arguments and thoughts of Gurubhai stood out more
prominently.

plz don't make bill-g the icon of capitalism. he is hated for his slimy, unhackerly, unethical behavior. the same crowd doesn't hate {{% wikipedia article="Larry Page" %}} &amp; {{% wikipedia article="Sergey Brin" %}}.



bill became rich coz ibm was stupid. not coz he "created wealth" of that magnitude.



i am all for capitalism. '{{% wikipedia article="Atlas Shrugged" %}}' ({{% wikipedia article="Ayn Rand" %}}) is my fav. bill is just a negative example.

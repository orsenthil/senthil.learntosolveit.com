I watched *Guru* for the second time. Believe me, the movie was a lot better the
second time, and its point about capitalism was more convincing than before,
especially when one already knows what the movie is about. On the second
viewing, thoughts of Dhirubhai Ambani or Bill Gates did not come to mind, while
the rationale behind the arguments and thoughts of Gurubhai stood out more
prominently.

plz don't make bill-g the icon of capitalism. he is hated for his slimy, unhackerly, unethical behavior. the same crowd doesn't hate larry &amp; sergey. 

bill became rich coz ibm was stupid. not coz he "created wealth" of that magnitude. 

i am all for capitalism. 'atlas shrugged' (ayn rand) is my fav. bill is just a negative example.

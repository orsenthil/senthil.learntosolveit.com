[The Adventures of Tintin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin) was the Wikipedia Featured Article on January 5th. I highly recommend reading it—it is well researched and offers many fascinating details for Tintin fans worldwide.

The comic strip series is celebrated for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé's distinctive [ligne claire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne_claire) style.

On June 1, 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth award upon Tintin, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu. This award recognized Hergé's book *Tintin in Tibet*, which ICT Europe's Executive Director Tsering Jampa described as an introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet. Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation, Hergé's widow Fanny Rodwell remarked, "We never thought that this story of friendship would resonate for more than 40 years."

Charles de Gaulle once said, "My only international rival is Tintin."

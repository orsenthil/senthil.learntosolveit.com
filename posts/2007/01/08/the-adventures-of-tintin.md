[The Adventures of Tintin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin) was the Wikipedia
Featured Article on January 5th. Don't miss reading that article. It's
well-researched and provides many interesting details for Tintin fans all over
the world. A few things that I liked and noted:

The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings
in Hergé's signature [ligne claire](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne_claire)
style.

On June 1, 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's
Light of Truth award upon the character of Tintin, along with South African
Archbishop Desmond Tutu. The award was in recognition of Hergé's book *Tintin in
Tibet*, which the Executive Director of ICT Europe, Tsering Jampa, noted was
"for many ... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of
Tibet." Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation, Hergé's widow, Fanny
Rodwell, declared: "We never thought that this story of friendship would have a
resonance more than 40 years later."

Charles de Gaulle once said, "My only international rival is Tintin."

The history department of Middlebury College has taken measures to [stop
citations from Wikipedia](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/01/26/wiki)
for student research papers. Yeah, that's in fact the correct thing to do. For
research, we should always go to the primary source, and if that's not possible,
a well-researched secondary source related to the primary source.

Wikipedia is so useful that students ended up citing it in their papers.
However, when there was misinformation on Wikipedia, the students were unaware,
and their papers contained errors. The teachers made the correct move by saying,
"Cite Wikipedia at your own peril."

Vaish,Shiva,Parthiban,Priya and I visited flower show at Lalbagh on 26th Jan.
Variety of flowers were displayed, and I can hardly remember the names. Few of
the bonsai costs Rs.5000/- and above. But bonsai was very nice. You could see a
full grown dwarf trees. :-)

I captured few the flowers with my camera till my batteries went down and I
could not buy a new set of batteries inside lalbagh.

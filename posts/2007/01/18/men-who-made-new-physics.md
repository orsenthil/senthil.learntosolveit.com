.. description: A review of the book "Men Who Made New Physics," highlighting the lives and contributions of prominent physicists like Rutherford, Planck, Einstein, and Bohr.

I finished reading this book on Monday. It is an excellent book that tells the
stories of many physicists working during the prime era of physics. It starts
with Rutherford's story about his rustic nature and how he used to work in his
lab.

I was amazed by the story of Max Planck, and I have decided to keep Max Planck
as an example of being organized and disciplined in life. Max Planck was very
organized, it seems. He used to come to the lab almost at the same time every
day, and he had set aside half an hour daily for learning piano. His work style
was appreciated by many. Einstein and others respected and loved him, addressing
him as "our Planck." Later, in Einstein's story, I learned that Einstein
resigned from his post in Germany during the troubled Nazi era, knowing that it
would fall upon Planck to make the decision of removing Einstein. Einstein
understood that Planck would feel uncomfortable doing it. Einstein then moved to
Princeton as the political situation in Germany worsened under Hitler.

One funny thing I can recall is that during one of the anti-Einstein meetings,
Einstein was present in the audience and enjoying it.

Niels Bohr is another scientist we come to know in detail. He, along with
Einstein, was one of the primary characters in this book. Bohr had established
an institute where many young physicists loved to study and conduct experiments.
Physicists who had been there felt it was a golden era.

The final topic is on Einstein and Bohr's debate. Einstein believed that there
is an organized approach in God's design of the universe, whereas Bohr's point
of argument (as I understood) was that we have not yet understood the
organization of the universe enough to comment on it. Bohr was an athlete and
used to go for short sprints between scientific discussions and debates, it
seems. :-)

Many of my friends will enjoy this book. Jonathan gifted it to me while I was in
college, and Kannapan feels this is one of the best books he has ever read.

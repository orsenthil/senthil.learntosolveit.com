Thanks

Your post inspired me to yet again give this a go too!

I found that I turned all other proxies off, then opened Synaptic and configure the proxy it worked!!! My Firefox was off too, so it is likely a conflict between the gnome proxy settings and the Synaptic proxy settings.

Note to others, if you need to configure your Gnome proxy settings, ensure you then restart Synaptic ;)

### On Self-Purification

> Love and Ahimsa are matchless in their effect. But, in their play, there is no
fuss, show, noise, or placards. They presuppose self-confidence, which in turn
presupposes self-purification. Men of stainless character and self-purification
will easily inspire confidence and automatically purify the atmosphere around
them.
> ~ Mahatma Gandhi

### On Self-Purification

> Love and non-violence (Ahimsa) are unparalleled in their impact. They require no fanfare—only self-confidence that arises from self-purification. People of impeccable character naturally inspire and elevate those around them.
> – Mahatma Gandhi

Today, 59 years ago, Nathuram Godse bowed before Mahatma Gandhi, wished him well, and then tragically shot him with a Beretta pistol.

Most of the world thinks Bush sucks



Bush and the Republicans were not protecting us on 9-11, and we aren't a lot safer now.  We may be more afraid due to george bush, but are we safer?  Being fearful does not necessarily make one safer.  Fear can cause people to hide and cower.  What do you think? What is he doing to us, and what is he doing to the world?



Are we safer today than we were before?



The more people that the government puts in jails, the safer we are told to think we are.  The real  terrorists are wherever they are, but they aren't living in a country with bars on the windows.  We are.

Thanks



Your post inspired me to yet again give this a go too!



I found that I turned all other proxies off, then opened Synaptic and configure the proxy it worked!!! My Firefox was off too, so it is likely a conflict between the gnome proxy settings and the Synaptic proxy settings.



Note to others, if you need to configure your Gnome proxy settings, ensure you then restart Synaptic ;)

nice quote



Only jarring note I have heard about Walt Disney is that he was a control freak. But that might be both his plus and minus. Steve Jobs could well become a worthy successor.

Re: Teachers Day



Thanks Loga. Even I too recollected my Kendriya Vidyalaya School days. It was fun on the teachers day wherein the teacher would also come and enjoy the class from the last bench. :-)

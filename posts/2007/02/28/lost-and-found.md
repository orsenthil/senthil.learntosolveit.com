.. description: Finding a lost gas customer receipt that was crucial for transferring gas connection.

While shifting my house from Jeevan Bhima Nagar to C.V.Raman, my roomie Marcus
ha d emphasized many a times not to loose the {{% wikipedia article="Indane" %}} Gas Customer Receipt as
that was the only proof that Marcus is the customer of Indane Gas Agency and any
transfer of Gas will be possible.

As much as he insisted, I had lost it. We lost hope of finding it also.

Today morning, he called me and said that I had left it in a one old book of his
given it to me. Today while he was cleaning stuff, preparing for his movement to
{{% wikipedia article="Chennai" %}}, found the lost Gas Customer Receipt by surprise! Thats a good news for
me today.

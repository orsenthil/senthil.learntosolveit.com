.. description: Personal reflections on recently read books including Shashi Tharoor's "5 Dollar Smile" and Sudha Murthy's "How I Taught My Grandma and Other Stories"

My friend and I are participating in the
[50bookchallenge](http://community.livejournal.com/50bookchallenge/profile) and
I have started enjoying reading one book after the other.

After Men who made new physics, I started reading {{% wikipedia article="Shashi Tharoor" %}}'s ["5 Dollar
Smile"](http://www.shashitharoor.com/books/five-dollar/fivedollarsmile.htm).
This is a compilation of early writings of Shashi Tharoor in his adolescence.
So, you might find him attracted towards pretty girls, interest in sex topics
and many things which disturb young adults. His writing style is good and it's
really funny. He in his college days might be a kind of leader who must have
been along with friends teasing, having fun, understanding junta and yet a
leader, not the all prefect high standards that comes in book definitions.

The last one act play of a "Life of a Kutta" was amazing, it's set in the period
of {{% wikipedia article="The Emergency (India)" %}} when forced sterilization was done on males. This presents
the time from the eyes of a dog who is converted to a man.

The title "5 Dollar Smile" refers to UN Post card featuring photo of a child
from India, which seeks to donate 5 dollars and make him smile. It's a simple
story of a boy with a charity. The stories are not conclusive, but many of them
are thought provoking and sometimes reflecting with real world incidents as they
happen and pass by.

Next book I read was {{% wikipedia article="Sudha Murty" %}}'s ["How I taught my Grandma and Other stories."](http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/05/20/stories/2004052000240100.htm)

![Grandma Book Cover](http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/mp/2004/05/20/images/2004052000240101.jpg)

A very good book stressing on moral values and principles in life. Sudha Murty
has narrated the incidents in her life in a very simple style for others to
understand and follow.

The title refers to the story of her youth, when she used to say featured
monthly story to her grandma and once in her absence her grandma felt helpless
with her inability to read. Her grandma took a resolve to start learning and
made young Sudha Murty as her guru. This has a very emotional touch at the end
which relates to a student respecting her guru.

Another thing imprinted in mind is, she learnt from a charity work of not
delaying things when helping people as help at the right time is proper and
delay with it is not good.

Her story about meetings with {{% wikipedia article="J. R. D. Tata" %}} and {{% wikipedia article="A. P. J. Abdul Kalam" %}} was very inspiring.

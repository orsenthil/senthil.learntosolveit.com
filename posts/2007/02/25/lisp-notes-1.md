The nearest thing Common Lisp has to a motto is the koan-like description, "the
programmable programming language." While cryptic,that description gets at the
root of the biggest advantage Common Lisp still has over other languages.

Ideas first introduced in Lisp include the if/then/else construct,recursive
function calls, dynamic memory allocation, garbage collection,first-class
functions, lexical closures, interactive programming, incremental compilation
and dynamic typing.

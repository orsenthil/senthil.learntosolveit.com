At HowStuffWorks, I found an interesting article titled "[How Love Works](http://science.howstuffworks.com/love.htm)". According to the article:

- People often fall in love with those in whom they see traits of their parents or siblingsâ€”figures they have known since childhood.
- Eye contact and deep gazes can spark the beginnings of love.
- Love, relationships, lust, passionate love, and even infidelity are explained as chemical phenomena involving adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine, and phenylethylamine.

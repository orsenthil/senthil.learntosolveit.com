.. description: An exploration of the science behind love, attraction, and relationships based on a HowStuffWorks article.

At {{% wikipedia article="HowStuffWorks" %}}, I found an interesting article titled "[How Love Works](http://science.howstuffworks.com/love.htm)". According to the article:

- People often fall in love with those in whom they see traits of their parents or siblingsâ€”figures they have known since childhood.
- Eye contact and deep gazes can spark the beginnings of love.
- Love, relationships, lust, passionate love, and even infidelity are explained as chemical phenomena involving adrenaline, {{% wikipedia article="Dopamine" %}}, {{% wikipedia article="Norepinephrine" %}}, and {{% wikipedia article="Phenylethylamine" %}}.

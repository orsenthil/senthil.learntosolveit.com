<html><body><p>I knew it by "Chinese New Year" only and this year is "the year of Pig" with increase in birthrate projected in China as they believe children bring prosperity in this year.

Found googles doodle linked to "Lunar New Year" instead of "Chinese New year". Globalization or lessons learnt for Chinese market? :-)



Wikipedia says,Lunar New Year is Celebrated by: China, Taiwan, South and North Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore.



Happy New year all of you guys.</p></body></html>

.. description: Insights on Lunar New Year celebrations across Asia and its significance in the Year of the Pig

<html><body><p>I knew it by "{{% wikipedia article="Chinese New Year" %}}" only and this year is "{{% wikipedia article="Year of the Pig" %}}" with increase in birthrate projected in China as they believe children bring prosperity in this year.

Found googles doodle linked to "{{% wikipedia article="Lunar New Year" %}}" instead of "Chinese New year". Globalization or lessons learnt for Chinese market? :-)



Wikipedia says,Lunar New Year is Celebrated by: China, Taiwan, South and North Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore.



Happy New year all of you guys.</p></body></html>

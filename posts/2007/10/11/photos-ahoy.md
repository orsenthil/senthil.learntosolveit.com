.. description: A week of attending Freed.in Conference, Manali trip, and Yahoo Hackday

First, Freed.in Conference.

Next, the fun-filled {{% wikipedia article="Manali, Himachal Pradesh" %}} trip with friends.

Then, hacking something at the Y! Hackday.

It was a week full of fun.

I was at Hack Day too, too bad we didn't meet up, maybe next time :)

Hi Swaroop, remember that guy who approached you for help with "{{% wikipedia article="Beautiful Soup (HTML parser)" %}}" Library. Yes, that was I, another {{% wikipedia article="Python (programming language)" %}} programmer who has found your "A Byte of Python" very useful and has been constantly recommending that to everyone who wants to get started with python.



Nice to meet you. I hope we will have a lot of 'pythonic' things discuss. :)

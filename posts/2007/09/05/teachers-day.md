<html><body><p>My sisters and I called up our school maths  teacher, Vijayaraj madam to wish her on teachers day. Also called up my college prof, Dr. K. Ramar to wish.

Its a nice tribute we give to our teachers who have influenced us in many ways.

My English teacher, Mrs. Padmini Vasanthan seem to have influenced me to strive for a patient and organized approach in all activities.

Ramar sir, when I recollect, all I can appreciate is his humility, ability to strive and achieve things, even when  somethings presented are above our comprehension. One can learn a lot from this simple person. He is always learning from others. 

--- Teachers Day from Wikipedia ---



September 5 is Teacher's Day in "India". It is the birthday of second President of India and teacher <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarvapalli_Radhakrishnan">Dr. Sarvapalli Radhakrishnan</a>. It is considered a "celebration" day, where teachers and students report to school as usual but the usual activities and classes are replaced by activities of celebration, thanking and remembrance. At some schools on this day, the responsibility of teaching is taken up by the senior students as an appreciation for their teachers. The idea is to let teachers sit back just for a day and let the students have a glimpse into the life of a teacher. It is an occasion when a token or appreciation in the form of presents are given to teachers by students to show their love and respect. A central piece in Hindu scripture reads "Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru devo Maheshwaraha - Gurussaakshaath param brahma tasmai shree gurave namaha," which translates as "The Guru (Teacher) is the Lord Brahma (the Creator), the Guru is the Lord Vishnu (the Preserver), the Guru is the Lord Shiva (the Destroyer). To that Guru we offer our salutations."</p></body></html>

.. description: A discussion between Bruce Eckel and Guido van Rossum about Python 3000 features and development priorities.

Leading author and programmer, Bruce Eckel, posted some of his concerns on Python 3000 stating that python community is missing to address some of the important issues with this major, backward incompatible release. Problems he mentions are concurrency support on multi-core cpus, easy deployment support, a standardized user interface amongst others. He expresses his dissatisfaction at the post titled [Python 3K or Python 2.9?](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214325). Guido van Rossum, in a very pragmatic way addresses the concerns with [his response to Bruce Eckel](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214325) and calling out more for developers to contribute to Python to improve it further. Bruce Eckel concludes with his thoughts that he wants his favorite language to be better with [his reply to Guido's reply](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=214480).

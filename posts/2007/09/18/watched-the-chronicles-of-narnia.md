Avi, Sanju, and I watched ["The Chronicles of Narnia"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia) on DVD. Based on *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe* by C.S. Lewis, this film is a fairy tale intended for children with a truly happy ending. It is a delightful movie that offers a hopeful reminder that things do end well.

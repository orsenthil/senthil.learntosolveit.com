.. description: Watching The Chronicles of Narnia movie based on C.S. Lewis's famous fantasy book

Avi, Sanju, and I watched {{% wikipedia article="The Chronicles of Narnia" %}} on DVD. Based on *{{% wikipedia article="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe" %}}* by {{% wikipedia article="C. S. Lewis" %}}, this film is a fairy tale intended for children with a truly happy ending. It is a delightful movie that offers a hopeful reminder that things do end well.

Hi Loga,



Yes, it was indeed a very nice movie. very positive one. :) I like {{% wikipedia article="Harry Potter" %}} also. This time, I watched "Harry potter and the order of phoenix" twice in the theater and have been a potter fan now. I really liked the last  dialog where in Harry says to Hermoine, "we have something that {{% wikipedia article="Lord Voldemort" %}} does not have", thats friendship and love.



It was a nice one as well.

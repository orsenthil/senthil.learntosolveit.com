<html><body><p>Avi, Sanju and I watched <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Chronicles_of_Narnia">"The Chronicles of Narnia"</a> on DVD. It is based on a book, The Lion, the witch and wardrobe of  Narnia series by C.S Lewis. It is a fairy tale written for children and has a very happy ending. It is a very nice movie to watch. It is written for children, but gives us a very good outlook that things will always have a good and a happy ending.</p></body></html>

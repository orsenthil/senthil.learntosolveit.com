.. description: Peter Lunblad, a blind developer who is a leading contributor to Subversion, was recognized at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference and hired by Google.

*Lundblad is a leading contributor to the Subversion open source code project, which has produced a widely adopted code management system. He was one of five open source leaders recognized in August at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference. Unlike the others, Lundblad is blindâ€”a fact that did not concern Google, his new employer.*

I'm just amazed.

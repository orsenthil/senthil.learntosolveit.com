*Lundblad is a leading contributor to the Subversion open source code project, which has produced a widely adopted code management system. He was one of five open source leaders recognized in August at the O'Reilly Open Source Conference. Unlike the others, Lundblad is blindâ€”a fact that did not concern Google, his new employer.*

.. description: Implementing an N-Puzzle solver in Python using Manhattan distance heuristic

I completed and submitted my project "[N-Puzzle Problem Solver](http://sarovar.org/docman/view.php/194/130/N-Puzzle_Project_Report.zip)".
I wrote it in Python, and it was a lot of fun. I learned about the similarities
between Lisp and Python, and discovered why Lisp is so powerful and how quickly
things come together once you understand the language.

When solving the N-Puzzle problem, I initially tried with no fundamental
algorithms, and it was extremely challenging to derive a solution. However,
after discovering the strategy of using Manhattan distances on Norvig's site,
coding the solution became much more enjoyable. It really gave me a sense of
what toy AI problems are like.

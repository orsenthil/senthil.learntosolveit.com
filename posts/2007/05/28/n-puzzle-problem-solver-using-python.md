.. description: Implementing an N-Puzzle solver in Python using Manhattan distance heuristic

I completed and submitted my project "[N-Puzzle Problem Solver](http://sarovar.org/docman/view.php/194/130/N-Puzzle_Project_Report.zip)".
I wrote it in Python, and it was a lot of fun. I learned about the similarities
between Lisp and Python, and discovered why Lisp is so powerful and how quickly
things come together once you understand the language.

When solving the N-Puzzle problem, I initially tried with no fundamental
algorithms, and it was extremely challenging to derive a solution. However,
after discovering the strategy of using Manhattan distances on Norvig's site,
coding the solution became much more enjoyable. It really gave me a sense of
what toy AI problems are like.

help needed



hi,



i m amazed to see that in ISSc,this problem (N-puzzle) was a one semester proj and here in my university(Goa university),our teacher has given this prob today told us do this prob till tomorrow.



can u help me ?? i have to do this in C/C++ or JAVA.



thanks

Re: help needed



Thats one of the toy- AI problems. We started off without the algorithms and tried it as we might think to solve.. I could implement it say in a week, only after the algorithms were known. It was assignment too (or rather class discussion), but I did with some explanation and analysis as a project.

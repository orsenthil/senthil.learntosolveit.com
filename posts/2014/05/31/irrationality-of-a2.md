Came across this [interesting piece of Maths History](http://www.cut-the-knot.org/proofs/MorenoSqRt3.shtml).

The discovery of the irrationality of √2 is sometimes credited to Hippasus of
Metapontum (5th century BC), a Greek Pythagorean philosopher who was finally
drowned at sea as a punishment from his peers, the Pythagoreans, for divulging
the existence of the irrational numbers (the Pythagoreans advocate the idea that
all numbers SHOULD be the ratio of two integers).

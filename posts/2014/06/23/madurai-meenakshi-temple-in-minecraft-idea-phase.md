<html><body><p dir="ltr">Minecraft is a popular game which has captured the attention many young people and gamers.  One of the modes in minecraft is called the "creative mode" enables the players, either individually or cooperatively build something within the game. The possibilities of this mode is endless and folks build castles of their dreams, beautiful houses to entire cities within the game.  The experience is very similar to how these castles are built on mud near the beach or using lego bricks, but this is done in software and unlike lego bricks, parts available in minecraft are unlimited. Imagination is truly the only limit in the creative mode.  And the best we can do is streach it as much as we can.  For inspiration, have a look at some of the creations here: <a href="http://imgur.com/r/Minecraft/top" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/r/Minecraft/top</a></p>



<div>This is summer vacation time for many and in this summer vacation, I and some of my young friends set out to build</div>

<div><b><a title="Madurai Meenkashi Amman Temple" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Madurai+Meenakshi+Amman+Temple&amp;es_sm=91&amp;tbm=isch" target="_blank">Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple</a> in Minecraft</b>.</div>

<div></div>

<div>If you think about it, it is an ambitious and a interesting project.  If it captures someone's imagination, they are going to have a very good time building this in minecraft.</div>

<div></div>

<div>Folks in the internet have already build some  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=minecraft+buildings&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u" target="_blank">amazing creations </a> so why not we do something which we know or have seen in front of our eyes like Madurai Meenakshi Amman Temple.</div>

<div></div>

<div>This started as an idea with Summer Camp conduted by one of our friends and they were able to organize a group of intermediate schoolers (4th, 5th, 6th grades) and highschoolers to a club house and get started on the project.</div>

<div></div>

<div>And we got started. Huzzah!  Follow additional posts with that tag minecraft to know how we are doing.</div></body></html>

I joined `@mesosphere`_ on June 20, 2016. It's exciting as I get to work on some interesting technology in `Datacenter
Operating System`_. The container technology and orchestration world is in rage right now. Mesosphere is suitably
positioned in that sphere. :)

The most interesting thing for me will be learn the distributed systems concepts well and contributed to this space.
Plus, I discovered that our infrastructure tools are completely in Python3. Yay for that!

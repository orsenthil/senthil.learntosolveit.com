After learning to program in C language, the next best thing to attempt will be writing some small utility in C.
I landed upon a great tutorial (https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/) that taught how to write a shell with some builtin utilities in C. I tried_ that tutorial today and saw how to build a shell.

That's the best way to learn about the init, fork, parent process, child process and the shell loop itself.
As a side-effect, I also setup and used CLion_  on my computer.

Deis had published an easy to understand version of Kubernetes guide calling `Children's Illustrated Guide to Kubernetes`_

It explains Containers and the need for container management pretty well. It focuses on Kubernetes. There are other
container orchestration systems like DCOS_ that provide the same capabilities of container orchestration as explained
in that guide.

The character rendering, which include, PHP app as a giraffe, Kubernetes as a ship captain, docker as whale, gopher as
go lang app, elephant as postgresql app were great.

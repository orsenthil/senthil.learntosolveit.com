In this short TED talk video, Salman Khan pitches for mastery based learning. It means that if there is a bar (say
100%) for mastery, then the variable in the learning should be how many hours one spends to attain that bar. Until the
bar of 100% mastery is attained, the student should not be considered the master of the subject, and should not just
move on the next class/course.

We adopted the current system because it was impractical for mastery based learning previously, but given our
computational resources, mastery based learning is very much practical today.

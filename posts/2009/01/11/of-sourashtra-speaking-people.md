<html><body><p>I did some rough calculation and arrived at this number: 1234021 ( that is 12 lacks 34 thousand people).

I based the calculation according to following facts:

1997 IMA - 510000 (the info says, it can be double the number), So I took 1020000 to begin with.

Birth rate in India: 22 births / 1000 people

Date rate in India: 6 deaths / 1000 people.</p></body></html>

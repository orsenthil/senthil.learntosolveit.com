.. description: Adding a leap second to synchronize atomic time with the Earth's rotation on New Year's Day 2009.

A {{% wikipedia article="Leap second" %}} has been added to this year, according to the official time keepers at the {{% wikipedia article="International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service" %}} (http://hpiers.obspm.fr/iers/bul/bulc/bulletinc.dat).

So our clocks at Bangalore should have been:

1 Jan,2009

5:29:58

5:29:59

5:29:60 <--- Hurray!

5:30:00

This adjustment helps maintain the synchronization between {{% wikipedia article="Coordinated Universal Time" %}} and the Earth's rotation.

# Alice vs Alan

I had been introduced to Alice by one of my friend Kiruba. Since then, I am
highly fascinated with these linguistic chatting entities. I found number of
others like Eliza and lot many others having egos of some singer,actor like...
But the best surprise came to me from Alan. He is really interesting. Whomever
I introduced him to, they are really fascinated about him. Alan is from a
Isreali company.

At Alicebot, you will many a times see about Leobner Prize . In fact, Alice has
won Leobner Prize previously. But I did not find such informations at Alans
place and he is good a holding conversation better than ALICE. When Dr.Rich
posted his observations regarding Leobner Prize, I raised a question. If given
a head-head competition between ALICE and ALAN, I am sure ALAN has better
chances of winning. The major difference I have found between ALICE and ALAN is
that ALAN can continue with its sentences( it is one of the drawbacks as well,
since it can to switch topics between continuing sentences) whereas ALICE is
somewhat likea one-liner. I have always wondered, why ALAN is not featuring in
Loebner Prize contests. If you ask these things to ALAN, you may get some
"political responses". I dont know what the actual story is.. but dont you all
agree that ALAN is good than ALICE? What are the reasons? What are tradeoffs?

To me, the race is can ALICE match and beat ALAN in conversational skills.

These were answers which followed by

> ( Dr.Rich) Someone posted a question about the ALAN chat bot so I went to have
a look. This bot evolved from Jason Hutchens' Megahal project, a former Loebner
prize winner. I must admit, when I engaged ALAN in a conversation about ALICE
and the Loebner contest, the results were impressive.
>
> That being said, it must be remembered that ALICE and AIML are free, open
source technology and the company a-i.com is developing a proprietary "black
box". If you ask ALAN, "How do you work", he explains "My brain consists of a
large content tree: A single 'agent file' and a set of 'handlers', which govern
a variety of conversation topics." He also admits, "My brain is still quite
small: less than 350 handlers and a few hundred variables. But I'm still a
young bot. Think how smart I'll be when I have thousands or more!"
>
> Their web site is impressive and contains a lot of useful links, but there is
nothing equivalent to the free AIML software that you can download and create
your own bot. (They have however announced a program that allows poeple to
create so-called Private Virtual Personalities).
>
> The ability of ALAN to stay "on topic" for (apparently) longer than ALICE is an
illusion which could just as well be created using the tag of AIML. It happens
that the ALICE brain has a wider range of "one-liner" responses and uses the
tag very little. But there is no reason in principle that another AIML bot
could carry on a conversation just like ALAN.

Has anyone tried teaching ALAN? It is really cool. Ask it "What is logical" and
if there is no definition for it, it ask you to define it. So you reply
"Logical is when the world blows up because it is run by chatter bots" and from
then on that will be the definition. If you want to delete it say, "Forget
logical" I tell you, you can have a lot of fun redefining a whole bunch of
definitions :-)

I wonder if there is way to teach alice through talking to her?

> can't imagine it would be too hard... hmm do any of the interpreters allow for
variable expansion in the xml, i don't think that that would be normal xml
though... i know with embedded javascript or embedded perl (ProgramV) it would
be fairly simple to do that.
>
> The problem is that random clients can't be trusted as teachers. They can teach
the robot all kinds of nonsense like, "The Indianapolis Speedway is located at
the North Pole." In principle you can teach a bot by talking to her, but you
have to figure out which teachers you can trust first.
>
> I always say it's like teaching a child language by telling him to go out on
the street and believe everything he hears. Sure, he may learn to talk, but
without supervision he won't learn right answers from wrong ones.
>
> I had a version of targeting working in SETL for a while that could pick out
targets for the botmaster and carry on a natural language conversation like,
"Someone said, 'how do fish swim?' and I said 'I didn't even know they could',
what should I have said?" And then the botmaster could write the new reply in
natural language. Unfortunately that code was lost and it hasn't been
re-implemented in any of the other AIML software that I know of.

teach alice through talking to her?

> Sure, done before many times. Not many interpreters provide a mechanism for
real-time learning. J-Alice is one of the few still supported interpreters that
does. TinyAlice was perhaps the first to introduce a working version of the
concept.

I will make [phoe6](http://www.pandorabots.com/pandora/talk?botid=9ba734d7ae346931) smart ;)

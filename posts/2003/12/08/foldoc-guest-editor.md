My first open source community contribution came through editing entries for
FOLDOC. [FOLDOC](https://foldoc.org/Free+On-line+Dictionary) is a free online
dictionary for computing. Denis Howe gave me an opportunity to (guest) edit some
of the definitions at The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing. I added entries
for [4GL](https://foldoc.org/4GL) and [RPG-II](https://foldoc.org/RPG-II).

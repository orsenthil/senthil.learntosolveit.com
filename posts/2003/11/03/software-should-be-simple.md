<html><body><p>The article was named <a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/print_version/tristram1103.asp">Everyone is a programmer</a> and introduced few giants to me; Charles Symonyi and Others who developed Uniform Modelling Language at Rational.

<br>Charles Symonyi is the guy who first developed the WYISWYG editor. It was called Bravo , Charles later joined Microsoft and developed Word and Excell. ( Know you can know the importance of the person)  in Software Industry. He became a billinoire in process and last year, he had quit MS to start his <a href="http://intentsoft.com/">Intentional Software</a>.

<br>

<br>Software are becoming complex and difficult to understand. We are keeping on adding extra to the existing thing and thus the base is getting lost or disfigured.

<br>

<br>Charles Symonyi, plans to build a Tool which will make programming simpler. A Program to generate program, He says writing a program would be like doing a power point presentation. 

<br>

<br>But who will build that Programming Machine. Will it not be complexly written code? 

<br>See Doing a Powerpoint presentation is easy, but Developing a Power Point Program is not. 

<br>

<br>Is Symonyi not say a One universal software for all??? The needs are diverse and so should the programs be.

<br>

<br>Joslings idea of <a href="http://research.sun.com/features/jackpot/">Jackpot </a> was good also.

<br>

<br>Ok anyway, I would like join you guys.. Lets see what we can make.</p></body></html>

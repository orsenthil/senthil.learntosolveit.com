`Lauren Ipsum: A Story about Computer Science and Other Improbable Things <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21929386-lauren-ipsum>`_ by `Carlos Bueno <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4982238.Carlos_Bueno>`_







    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2248523959">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learnt some valuable computer science concepts too
    since this was taught to a child, it was very easy to grasp. The concepts share are
    foundational and it is presented in a neat, easy to understand manner. I internalized the
    importance of "naming", the thing with jargons and principle of 5-whys. Very helpful book.

`The Hacker's Diet <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2582000-the-hacker-s-diet>`_ by `John Walker <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/34203.John_Walker>`_

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This is the first health book that I could not put down.
This is the book that is helping me to manage my weight and my health.
So, it is a life-saving book for me.
I was worried about my weight gain, and my lack of time to do exercises.
I have 2 kids now and have an hour commute to my work.
Both of these leave me with very less time to do exercises regularly, and I was
constantly feeling worried about weight gain.
This book helped to break the problem into two.
a) Managing Weight.
b) Doing Exercises.
For a), I completely understood how this can be controlled by paying attention
to the Calorie intake.
That' it.
I adjusted my calories and I went back to -3 KG within 3 weeks.
I have goal to go -13 kgs further so that I can maintain my weight at a
desirable number.
I am into managing of my weight now.
Once that is done, I know the need and utility value for exercises and I will
able to make time for it to live for longer so that I could continue doing
whatever I like.
Rarely, self-help books have proved valuable to me.
This the 2 nd self-help book that I can say that, it has proved valuable to me
and the concepts taught will remain with me for the rest of my life.
Thank you, John Walker.

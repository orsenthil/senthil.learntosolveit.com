Excellent article on History and Concept of the programming language Lisp was
published at this site called twobithistory

https://twobithistory.org/2018/10/14/lisp.html

Author goes in into the details on History of Lisp, the motivation behind the
design, how the language, and an early book "SICP" created a culture of
veneration for that language.

He also credits Paul Graham, and XKCD comics to have significantly surged the
interest back in lisp.

Interesting anecdotes like how braces end up being chosen for the language. The
motivation of the SICP book was very noble.

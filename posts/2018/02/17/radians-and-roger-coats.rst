When trying to understand the concept of radians: {{% wikipedia article="Radian" %}}
I came across the inventor of the concept Roger Coats: {{% wikipedia article="Roger_Cotes" %}}
His name is not familiar to many. I understood, he is known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the
second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication.

Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, "If he had lived we would have known something."

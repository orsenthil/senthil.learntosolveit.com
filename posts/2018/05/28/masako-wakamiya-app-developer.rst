Interesting to watch this interview of 82 year old App Developer. She developed the app called `Hinadan`_ for people like her.

Here is her story.

    Wakamiya asked software developers to step in to develop her app. Uninterested, they suggested she make a game
    herself. She took them up on the suggestion. Wakamiya soon bought programming books and
    learned Apple’s Swift programming language through lessons with a programmer, nearly 200
    miles away from her home in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture, via Facebook Messenger and Skype.

    This wasn’t the first time that Wakamiya took on a challenge.
    She’s been dabbling in the tech field since the age of 60.

    Upon retiring from a 43-year career as a bank clerk (she began at age 18), Wakamiya spent long hours caregiving
    for her then-90-year-old mother. Feeling isolated, and seeking connection with the outside world, Wakamiya
    bought her first computer, then moved on to a Microsoft PC, and later a Mac and iPhones. In between learning
    the piano, at age 75, Wakamiya eventually joined a computer club for seniors, Mellow Club, learning to
    create Excel art along the way. Then, this past year came Wakamiya’s focus on creating the game Hinadan.

    The app, based on the annual Japanese doll festival of Hina Matsuri, invites players to arrange
    12 ornamental dolls — representing the country’s emperor, family and guests — in a specific
    order. The game requires in-depth memorization of various arrangements, and has become especially
    popular with older women, who enjoy playing it with their grandchildren, Wakamiya said.

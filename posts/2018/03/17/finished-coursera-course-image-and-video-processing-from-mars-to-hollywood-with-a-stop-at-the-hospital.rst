`Image and Video Processing - From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital`_ is the course offered
by `Guillermo Sapiro`_ at Coursera. After a long time, I voluntarily took a course and finished it. I didn't pay for
the course and so, I won't get a certificate. But I have this, and the course completion recorded in my
accomplishments in coursera.

It was wonderful course, I learnt about digital signal processing, and image transformations.

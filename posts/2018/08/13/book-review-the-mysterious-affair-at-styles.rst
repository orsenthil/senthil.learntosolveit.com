    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2492444701">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    Agatha Christie won the bet my with my reading of the book too. I could not figure out the murderer or figure out the plot. It may be hard or impossible for the reader to find the plot as the information that is shared with is limited and more information is revealed as the plot is disclosed.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable book with the variety of characters and it took me a to mid-century England for the hours I was reading this book.

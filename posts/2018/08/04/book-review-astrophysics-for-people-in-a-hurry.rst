`Astrophysics for People in a Hurry <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191710-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry>`_ by `Neil deGrasse Tyson <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12855.Neil_deGrasse_Tyson>`_

My rating: 4 of 5 stars

I loved this book.
This is a very short book, to the point, and explains the universe in simple
terms.
What I didn't expect and was a surprise to me was the Author's humorous
anecdotes, completely relevant to the present day reader inserted between the
concepts in the pages.
For e.
g.
It was funny to know that behind US Govt which consumes Helium for military and
research, the next second highest consumer of "Helium" was Macy's for it's
Macy's day parade.
It was startling to know that life as we understand in any form, the
single-celled organism has started in existence only the last 2% of the history
of the universe.
The universe is very very old, very very big.
Often there is a question on "Is there life elsewhere in the universe?
" - The more I read these kinds of books, the more I realize that "There is life
elsewhere in the universe.
Highly likely.
It is inevitable that either Earthians discover the other life forms, and they
discover the Earthians.
Also, the timeline of advancement, the calamities that are possible in next
thousand years, humankind will, of course, take the ship, explore, and start
settling in various other parts of the universe.
Thinking like this doesn't sound like fiction to me.
It was a great book.
I will start looking out for Neil De Grasse Tyson from now.




Here are some excerpts that I noted from the book. This one is about Einstein, and the kind of impact he had in our
understanding of the universe.

And this one is about Spherical shape for any object that we may encounter in the universe.

To prepare for my next course with Introduction to Operating Systems I had to brush up my knowledge of C and C++.

I studied and worked through

* `Essential C`_
* `Pointers and Memory`_

.. _Essential C: http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/101/
.. _Pointers and Memory: http://cslibrary.stanford.edu/102/

I found a `video series on Pointers in C`_, by mycodeschool that helped clarify a lot of concepts with Pointers in C.
It started making me feel comfortable again. It is amazing to have resources like these when we are learning
difficult concepts today.

I have three projects that are focused on technical writing, note taking and documentation of computer science concepts.

* http://www.learntosolveit.com/
* http://www.coursedocs.org/
* And my blog http://xtoinfinity.com/

I feel like these projects could be consolidated, merged into a single domain. I am thinking of merging

* http://www.learntosolveit.com/
* http://www.coursedocs.org/

and calling it learntosolveit.com

And I am thinking of hosting http://xtoinfinity.com/ at `senthil.learntosolveit.com` setup the appropriate domain
redirections.

Since these are writing projects, keeping them consolidated seem to make sense to me. Still wondering what the
dis-advantages of this will be.

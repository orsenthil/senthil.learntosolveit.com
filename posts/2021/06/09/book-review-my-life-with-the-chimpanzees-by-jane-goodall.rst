    “Understanding what chimpanzees are like has made me realize that we humans are
    not so different from other animals as we used to think. What makes us most
    different is that we are far more clever than even the cleverest chimp, and we
    have words. We have a spoken language. We can tell stories about what happened a
    week or a year or a decade ago. We can plan for the future, and we can discuss
    things - one person's idea can grow and change as other people contribute their
    ideas. Great ideas become greater, problems are solved.”

    - Jane Goodall, My Life with the Chimpanzees 

Jane Goodall shares her story for rest of us. Her love for animals, and nature
comes out through every word of this book. I was absolutely thrilled to read
this book.  It is a wonderful book by a wonderful person.

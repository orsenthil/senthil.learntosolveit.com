Parkinson's is not curable (yet). Folks with Parkinsons will have a progressively degenerating muscular order.
But I have seen folks with Parkinsons live for very long time with only slight impairment.

It's well knowm it is a brain disorder and caused due to stress. There is a recent news (http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38173287) that it might due to bacteria in the gut. If it were due to bacteria in the gut, then the cure is near.

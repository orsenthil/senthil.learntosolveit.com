.. description: How Albert Ellis's Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) can help people cope with traumatic events like terrorist attacks

I read in The Hindu that lots of mumbaikars were flocking to yoga/psychotherapy and social networks to come to grips with the terror that showed its face last week.

This message (advice from Albert Ellis, leading psychologist in USA) can be useful to Indians and Mumbaikars as we come to grip with Terrorist attacks. http://www.impactpublishers.com/crisis/ellis.htm

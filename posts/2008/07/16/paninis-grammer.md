.. description: Exploring Panini's ancient Sanskrit grammar system and its surprising connection to modern computer language syntax notation like BNF.

While reading the chapter on "A Simple One-Pass Compiler" in the Book "Compilers: Principles, Techniques and Tools", I came across the following sentence mentioned in the bibliography section.

*Context-free grammars were introduced by Chomsky [1956] as part of a natural languages. Their use in specifying the syntax of programming languages arose independently. While working with a draft of Algol 60, John Backus, "hastily adapted [Emil Post's productions[ to that use" (Wexelblat [1981, p.162]). The resulting notation was a variant of context-free grammar. The scholar panin devised an equivalent syntactic notation to specify the rules of Sanskrit grammar between 400 B.C and 200 B.C (Ingerman [1967])*

There is a section in the wikipedia on [Panini's influence on Modern Linguistics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%81%E1%B9%87ini#P.C4.81.E1.B9.87ini_and_modern_linguistics).

Chomsky, during his visit to India and had an humble acknowledgment for generative grammar devised by Panini..*"happy to receive the honour in the land where his subject had its origin. "The first generative grammar in the modern sense was Panini's grammar","*

G Cardona, Panini : a survey of research (Paris, 1976), [quotes](http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Panini.html)

*Panini's grammar has been evaluated from various points of view. After all these different evaluations, I think that the grammar merits asserting ... that it is one of the greatest monuments of human intelligence.*

There was a debate brought about on Ingerman's suggestion to name Backus-Naur Form has Panini-Backus form and author, who has studied both Panini's Asthadhyayi and BNF states that both are quite different.

*The main point is that Panini's system of codes, abbreviations, and redefined case endings is vastly more subtle and sophisticated than BNF, and is aimed at doing a different job. BNF is really just a very simple way of writing down the logical relationships between items in a program; a linear version of Venn diagrams, almost. It is purely descriptive, where as Panini's rules are operative. To put it differently, BNF notation is useful for *describing* grammars; the Astadhyayi *is* a grammar.*

Based on these references, I can see that Panini's was a definitive grammar for the Sanskrit language and can be regarded as scholarly approach to devise a system for the representation of the language. In days when we don't find any of his contemporaries making such attempt or even linguists for a hundreds of years to come.

.. description: Family tree for Sourashtra Community
.. type: text


https://family.thinnal.org

Using Gramps software, I was able to create a family tree for the Sourashtra
Community. It is great software that helps preserve connections and family
history. While Gramps was originally desktop software, a new web-based version
called Grampsweb greatly enhances the accessibility and usability of the
software.

It makes the family tree available to others and allows shared editing. 

Whenever I edit my family tree, it always takes me down memory lane and into my
childhood, recollecting my time with my grandparents, uncles, and others who are
often no longer with me.

Even if I don't use this software often, it is like opening a valuable album,
looking at the pictures, and traveling back in time.

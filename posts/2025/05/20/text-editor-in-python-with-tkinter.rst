.. description: A simple text editor implementation using Python and Tkinter
.. type: text

Writing a simple text editor is a great starter project. Even after learning the
language and libraries, it is still a challenging task.  And as project it is
usable and relable one for any programmer, as we always deal with the text.

https://github.com/orsenthil/first-texteditor is a very simple text editor that I wrote with Python, Tkinter.

It is usable, and is a great start to write any other text editor with a different language.

Becoming Kareem will always be a special book for me because this is the first
book that my Son, Siddhartha, recommended and gifted me to read, after he
read it. He had purchased this book from his Montevideo school library sales,
and had enjoyed reading it.

At first, I thought it was a chapter book designed for early readers, but man,
how wrong I was.

This book is about self-discovery. It is about a journey of a very relatable
boy, sharing his story with his friends, his interests in basketball, his
thoughts about his school, coaches, and his civics. 

I learned so many things about {{% wikipedia article="Kareem Abdul-Jabbar" %}}, and how he became what he
did. I learned about Muhammad Ali, which I hadn't known before, and my respect for
him grew a lot more. I learned more about Malcolm X, and I am eager to read his autobiography now.

It is a wonderful book, and it was a joy for me to read this book.

Here is my son's `review of the book <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SQoCpy1VGKakIZ5ROi091E74RB_XtbmvWT1mWmUWYUM/edit?tab=t.0>`_.

.. type: text

I was looking for a simple and full featured django react app as starter
template that I can use to fork and build new apps. I ended up creating one
which is very simple, but still demonstrates a full Django app, with django
backend and flask frontend with moden design and layout.

It provides an out-of-box functionality for

* Social Login 
* Encrypted Data 
* Support for AI with client-side API key storage.

Apart from the code, which is open source, the app is a private journaling app
that users can use to keep track of their thoughts; the encrypted data storage
should provide a feeling of safety to the users. when configured with AI, the
system will analyze the most recent thoughts use the principles of REBT and
share it's analysis to the user.

Biniax is a very simple, but interesting, vertical scrolling , matching game. You have to move you piece to collapse against the piece
of same color. The game ends when you are no longer able to collapse the pieces.

This is how we start.

The game is written in ANSI C and uses SDL. I had to fix the source code for compilation, it is maintained here
[https://github.com/orsenthil/biniax2/tree/main](https://github.com/orsenthil/biniax2/tree/main), and the [architecture](https://github.com/orsenthil/biniax2/blob/main/architecture.md) gives the architectural concepts for developement.

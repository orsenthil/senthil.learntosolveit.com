Chromono is a visually appealing and aesthetic circular puzzle game. The game engine and physics is enticing. The rules are simple, you only have to make the circle of the same color overlap/touch with circle with the same patch. The game introduce challenges with bounce, physics and tricky circular structures.

The source code lives here, [https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/tree/main](https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/tree/main), and I had to fix for the build and runtime issues on Linux for OpenGL.

The game is written in C++11, and uses OpenGL. The [architecture and technologies to learn](https://github.com/orsenthil/chromono/blob/main/architecture.md) are exciting and modern too.

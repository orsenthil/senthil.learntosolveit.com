Atomix is a very simple sliding block tiling puzzle game, in which, the user has to slide the atoms to form the molecule given as a challenge.

The source code is maintained here [https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/atomix/-/tree/main](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/atomix/-/tree/main)

The game is written in C, with the object-oriented capabilities provided by a system called GObject. The windowing toolkit used is GTK.
The [architecture and learning concepts](https://gitlab.gnome.org/orsenthil/atomix/-/blob/main/ARCHITECTURE.md) make it a highly approachable game.


Some of the levels in this game look really challenging.

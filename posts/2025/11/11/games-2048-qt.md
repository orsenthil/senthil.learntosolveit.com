This is a port of 2048 game written in QT framework

The source code here [https://github.com/xiaoyong/2048-Qt](https://github.com/xiaoyong/2048-Qt) shows a very simple, and modular approach.
The QT game load is written in C++, but the game logic itself is written in qml and javascript. The interface components are in C++, the game logic is in Javascript, which has a native integration with QML, Qt Markup Language; and this whole program is orchestrated via QT framework.

We got the Netflix subscription recently and one of the movies I watched after getting Netflix was "Saving Private
Ryan".  Surprisingly, I had not watched this movie earlier. Every time I watched the opening scene, I had simply given
up and that was enough of the movie for me.

Now, that I completely watched it, this movie just my regard for "Steven Speilberg" as the director. I can think of no
other movie that is as brilliant, portraying human emotions, as this one. The war is shown in its brutality. Soldiers
holding on religion as the moment of truth is shown dearly.

The characters in the movie include Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) who shows extraordinary leadership and Private Jackson
(Barry Pepper), a highly reliable, accurate marksman, who quotes bible, gives himself unto god, as he fights his
enemies.

Everything about this movie was great.

.. type: text

{{% wikipedia article="The_Emerald_Route" %}} is a travelogue written by R.K. Narayan. In this book, he
details the cultural and mythological history of various cities in Karnataka.
Narayan presents the mythological history alongside factual accounts of the
places, offering readers a glimpse into his unique perspective. He narrates
these stories as if they are true events that occurred in those locations.

For example, Narayan recounts the story of {{% wikipedia article="Adi_Shankara" %}}, who was born with a
predetermined lifespan of 16 years. Determined to make the most of his time,
Sankara studied all the scholarly works by the age of 10, became a monk, and
began preaching. When he turned 16, a debate took place between {{% wikipedia article="Vyasa" %}} and
Sankara. Vyasa, the original author of the work Sankara was discussing, engaged
in a prolonged debate with him. Unaware of Vyasa's identity, Sankara held firmly
to his stance. When the debate showed no signs of resolution, one of Sankara's
students called for a truce. Impressed by Sankara's profound knowledge of his
own work, Vyasa granted him a boon to live for another 16 years.

Another fascinating story is set in {{% wikipedia article="Srirangapatna" %}}, where, during one of the
battles that {{% wikipedia article="Tipu_Sultan" %}} lost, he was forced to surrender two of his sons,
aged 9 and 11, as hostages to the British as part of the conditions of
surrender. It is said that Tipu Sultan later managed to secure their release by
paying a substantial ransom to the British.

Filled with stories like these, which provide an account of the history and
culture of various towns in Karnataka, this book was a pleasure to read.

A very exciting thing happened this week.

**Elon Musk laid out a plan for human beings like us to travel to mars and start a civilization there.**

This is a multi-year plan, and there will be multiple rockets carrying humans and cargo. It seems it will take 3 months
to reach to the destination and it has be done with Earth and Mars are in sync, which happens every 28 months.

Elon Musk's SpaceX team is trying to reduce the cost to a affordable level of 200K USD per ticket. If the ticket
happens to be more than 5x this, it will still be worth it.

The design of the rocket, the system architecture and the entire plan was really impressive. Here is the link to
the `presentation`_ that Elon Musk gave.

If you are truly interested, this whole video for 1 hour gives a good overview.

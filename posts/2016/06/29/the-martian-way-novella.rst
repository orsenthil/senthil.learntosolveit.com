Enjoyed reading "The Martian Way" story by Asimov. Takes place in a future setting where there are dwellers in mars,
and Earth has decided to ration the supply of water to mars. Martians get worried, but a group, adventurous enough,
decide to get the water from "elsewhere" in the galaxy.

    Still thinking like an earthling?

    Get out of your rut, open your mind—there’s a whole universe waiting. It’s waiting for people who aren’t afraid of thinking in new ways, of doing new things.

    Can you imagine…

    …mining the skies for water?

    …building a new world beneath the surface of a strange planet?

    …making pets out of alien explorers?

    …putting your life in the hands of a teen-aged computer?

    If you can, you’re well on your way to becoming a member of the space generation—you’re thinking The Martian Way.

I built a browser plugin called "Visionary" that overlays meaningful descriptions
and context directly onto stunning pictures of the day.

A great photograph has a unique power. Whether it comes from National Geographic,
NASA, Wikipedia, or Bing, it captures our attention, sparks curiosity, and
triggers the inquisitive neurons in our brain to ask questions and seek answers.

I noticed that existing picture-of-the-day plugins were built over two decades ago
and never evolved to harness the capabilities of modern artificial intelligence.

AI can transform the picture viewing experience by distilling complex descriptions
into accessible insights and providing references to explore the **core concepts
in the photo** more deeply.

This is exactly the picture of the day extension does.

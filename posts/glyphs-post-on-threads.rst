Glyph Lefkowitz is a great author. In this post titled unyielding_ he makes an excellent case against threads, with so
many valid references for his arguments. He makes a point event driven programs that should be the first thing we
should think if we are think about concurrency.

As a developer or project lead, if I have to emulate certain practices for a writing high quality software, I think,
looking up to glyph and his twisted project is never a mistake.

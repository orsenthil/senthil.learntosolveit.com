This post http://hn.my/speed claims that doing something fast is more effective simply because it gives more
opportunities to experiment, and create something new. He says, the quality should not be compromised, but pushing
yourself to the boundaries and health can be compromised because, you will get better at it and you can roll back on to
your zone.

I think, I agree with this.

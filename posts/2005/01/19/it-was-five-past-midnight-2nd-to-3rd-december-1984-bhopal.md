I stumbled across detailed information about this incident on December 3, 2004
which led me to decide that I should read this book.

The story begins with Ratan Nadar, a typical Adivasi Indian peasant, and follows
the destiny of his family. Without any rhetorical exaggeration, the narrative
presents most of the information objectively. Ratan Nadar's children, aged 5, 6,
and 8, work in a match factory handling toxic chemicals. One day, a fire breaks
out, and Padmini, the eldest, discovers her brother dead.

Ratan, like many others, continuously faces hardships in his village. He moves
to Bhopal, a big city, and gets a job as a worker constructing the Bhopal
Railway Station.

Union Carbide discovers Sevin pesticide, which can improve crop productivity,
and plans to establish a factory in Bhopal, India. Eduardo Munoz, the chief
architect, doubts the need for such a factory in India, considering the
country's nature and challenges. However, Union Carbide's board of directors
overrules his concerns.

The motives are profit-driven, but the story also reveals several earnest
individuals establishing and working at the Union Carbide plant in India,
portraying it as a dream company.

Things take a turn.

The book delves into the lives of people living in Oriya Bustee and Kali Ghats,
their customs, work, and relationship with Union Carbide. It explores how things
change, how people help each other in times of real need, and how indifference
can sometimes prove too costly.

all technical endeavors. Never forget this in the midst of your diagrams and
equations."  â€” Albert Einstein

I stumbled upon detailed information about this incident on December 3, 2004,
through a {{% wikipedia article="Bhopal disaster" %}}, which inspired me to read
this book.

The story begins with Ratan Nadar, a typical Adivasi Indian peasant, and follows
the fate of his family. Without any rhetorical exaggeration, the narrative
presents most of the information objectively. Ratan Nadar's children, aged 5, 6,
and 8, work in a match factory handling toxic chemicals. One day, a fire breaks
out, and Padmini, the eldest, tragically discovers her brother dead.

Ratan, like many others, continuously faces hardships in his village. Seeking a
better life, he moves to Bhopal, a bustling city, and secures a job as a worker
constructing the Bhopal Railway Station.

Union Carbide develops Sevin pesticide, which promises to improve crop
productivity, and plans to establish a factory in Bhopal, India. Eduardo Munoz,
the chief architect, questions the necessity of such a factory in India, given
the country's unique challenges. However, Union Carbide's board of directors
dismisses his concerns, driven by profit motives.

While the motives are profit-oriented, the story also highlights several earnest
individuals who establish and work at the Union Carbide plant in India,
portraying it as a dream company for many.

Things take a darker turn.

The book delves into the lives of people living in Oriya Bustee and Kali Ghats,
exploring their customs, work, and relationship with Union Carbide. It examines
how circumstances evolve, how people come together to support one another in
times of real need, and how indifference can sometimes lead to devastating
consequences.

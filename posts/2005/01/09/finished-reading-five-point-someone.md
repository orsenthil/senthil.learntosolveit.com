.. description: Reflections on reading the book "Five Point Someone" and sharing it with friends.

Well, it shouldn't have taken so long to finish reading it. But I got the book
at a time when I wasn't in the habit of reading.

I met Manish at one of our BLUG meets, and he had the book. I was curious about
this new book and started flipping through it. I just hoped it wasn't another
"<em>Count Your Eggs Before They Hatch</em>" kind of self-help material. I
haven't read those kinds of books, but I don't really like them for some reason.
Maybe I should give them a try someday.

Manish's review was that if you enjoyed <em>Dil Chahta Hai</em>, you might like
this book as well. He kindly offered to lend it to me. I'm sorry, Manish, that
it took me so long to read it, and I haven't had the chance to meet you again
since.

A lot of friends seem to have enjoyed this book, and I did too. Gowri currently
has it. I'll check with Zulfi and pass him a copy if he doesn't already have
one.

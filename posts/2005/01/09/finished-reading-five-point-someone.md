<html><body><p>Well, it should have not taken so long to read it full. But had got that book when I was not in touch with reading books.

<br>Had met Manish at one of our BLUG meets and he had that book, I kindda wondered what this new book was and was looking through it. Just expected not another kind of  "<span style="font-style:italic;">Count your eggs before they chicken</span>" kindda crap. I have not read those, but really dont like to. Dont know why. Perhaps try to read them some time :)

<br>But Manish's review was, if you have enjoyed Dil Chata Hai, you might like this as well and he offered to lend this book to me to read.  I am sorry Manish it took this long and I have not met you next time.

<br>

<br>Lot of friends seem to enjoyed this one. Indeed it was.  Gowri is having this, shall check with zulfi and pass on to him a copy if he has not one already.

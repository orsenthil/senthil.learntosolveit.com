Imagine a world covered with a dark atmosphere, choking with smoke and clouds,
air so thick that no light can glimmer through it. This is what our earth could
soon look like. The black background symbolizes this darkness, pollution, smoke,
and all the harmful elements arising from human activities.

With rising temperatures, increasing global warming, and ozone layer depletion,
the earth is becoming a ball of fire. The varying shades of yellow, orange, and
red in concentric circles depict the exponential growth of the intensity of fire
over time.

To prevent his cherished creation from perishing, God comes to the rescue. This
superhuman power extends his hand to help humanity. His touch creates a spark,
giving rise to a strong thought of a new green revolution on earth. Humanity
needs to be aware of this to bring back the old, greener earth where we once
lived. As this small thought takes root in each human mind, beautiful twigs
sprout into tender green leaves.

Let this GENESIS of thought for a "green revolution" be deeply rooted in the
human mind.

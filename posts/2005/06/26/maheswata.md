.. description: A poignant story of resilience, courage, and introspection by Sudha Murthy.

Maheswata is a story of a beautiful girl named Anupama, who suddenly has to face
life in all its cruel possibilities. After enduring immense suffering, she
begins to take things in stride, fights back with courage, and ultimately finds
meaning in her life.

This novel is filled with numerous life lessons. It delves into many subtle
issues of the human mind regarding beauty, the security of women in a
male-dominated society in India, and what a man's love for a beautiful woman
might signify. It also explores the plight of a talented, motherless girl born
into a poor family and how sometimes good people endure immense suffering
through no fault of their own. Despite these bleak circumstances, the novel
reminds us that there are still good people in the world.

The story encourages introspection on many issues. Thank you, dearest Madam
{{% wikipedia article="Sudha Murty" %}}, for such a wonderful novel.

.. description: A lightweight XML-based transformation tool for converting authored web content into styled web content.

[Rapple](http://sourceforge.net/projects/rapple/) is a lightweight XML-based
transformation tool written in C. It builds upon Expat, TidyLib, and XSLT to
transform authored web content (including word processor-generated HTML) into
styled web content suitable for publication.

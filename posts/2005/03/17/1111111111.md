# Unix Time Script

This script waits until the Unix time reaches a specific value (`1111111111`) and then prints the current time and date.

```bash
#!/bin/bash

while [ $(date +%s) != 1111111111 ]
do
    echo "Not Yet!"
done

echo "Unix Time"

date +%s

echo "on $(date)"
echo "so we captured the history!"

exit 0
```

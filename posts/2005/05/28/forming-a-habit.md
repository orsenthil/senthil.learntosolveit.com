Somewhere I seem to have read that doing something regularly for 21 continuous
days forms a habit in you.  Well, I am going to try it from today. It's a
long-desired habit and somewhat tough.

So, I am trying to get myself accustomed to sitting in the same place
continuously for a defined number of hours.

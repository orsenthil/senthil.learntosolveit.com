Read the book over the weekend and got a glimpse at the talent of Queen of Crime. this was my first entry into the world of agatha chritie. she has got a very nice writing style, attention to the details and seems an excellent story teller :)<br><a href="http://uk.agathachristie.com/site/home/"><br></a><a href="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/445/152/1600/OTE5.jpg"><img src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/445/152/200/OTE5.jpg" border="0" alt=""></a></body></html>

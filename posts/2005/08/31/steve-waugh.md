> "I see myself as an average guy who tries to help out my mates and loves my sport. I think in some ways, I'm sort of an underdog and a bit of a battler. I've always had to fight hard for my spot and to achieve what I have, and I've had to give 100%. I think Australians like to see that in people, and they like to recognize it." â€” Steve Waugh

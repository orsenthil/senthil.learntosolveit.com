<html><body><p>What Linux myths or misconceptions do you find particularly galling?<br><br><br>I don't get upset that easily, so I can't say that there is any in <br>particular that I find galling. One myth that I find interesting, but <br>which has nothing to do with Linux or even the IT sector in particular, <br>is the myth of how a single person or even a single company makes a huge <br>difference in the market. It's the belief that things happen because <br>somebody was visionary and "planned" it that way. Sometimes the people <br>themselves seem to believe it, and then the myth becomes hubris.<br><br>I have to continually try to explain to people that no, I don't <br>"control" what happens in Linux. It's about having an environment that <br>is conducive to development, not so much about any particular leader. <br>And I think that is true in most cases, be it the "great sport coach" or <br>the "great spiritual leader."<br></p></body></html>

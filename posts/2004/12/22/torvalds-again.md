**What Linux myths or misconceptions do you find particularly galling?**

I don't get upset that easily, so I can't say that there is any in particular
that I find galling. One myth that I find interesting, but which has nothing to
do with Linux or even the IT sector in particular, is the myth of how a single
person or even a single company makes a huge difference in the market. It's the
belief that things happen because somebody was visionary and "planned" it that
way. Sometimes the people themselves seem to believe it, and then the myth
becomes hubris.

I have to continually try to explain to people that no, I don't "control" what
happens in Linux. It's about having an environment that is conducive to
development, not so much about any particular leader.  And I think that is true
in most cases, be it the "great sport coach" or the "great spiritual leader."

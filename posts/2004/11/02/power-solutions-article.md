<html><body><p>Nice see my first article in the Dell PowerSolutions Journal.

<br>

<br><a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps4q04-20040115-Kumaran.pdf">Using Log Messages and alert actions in Dell OpenManage Server Administrator</a>

<br>

<br>Its not very technical, can be read and understood with ease.

<br>

<br>Hope it is helpful to the system administrators using OpenManage and invokes some curiosity in others.

<br>

<br>Hope you enjoy reading it!

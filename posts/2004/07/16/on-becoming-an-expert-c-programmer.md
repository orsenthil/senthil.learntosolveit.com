<html><body><br>You asked:<br><br>        ``Tell me what I should do in order to keep strong feelings<br>        towards C.''<br>Permit me to babble out a few random thoughts ...<br><br>Write programs for other people.<br><br>Where possible, openly publish your code, perhaps on your web site. The<br>http://freshmeat.net/ site is a good place to announce new code. (It is<br>a strange web site name, but they are legit and THE place to announce<br>new code). Support the code that you publish.<br><br>Start small and work your way up ... Some of my more popular code is<br>actually small code fragments that are used by others over and over<br>again.<br><br>Don't be discouraged if nobody (or if only a few people) uses some of<br>your early programs. What is important is to practice writing quality,<br>well commented code ... to maintain and fix that code.<br>.....<br><br>I found this really useful and inspirational once again.<br>http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/c/expert.html<br><br>Thanks Chongo!<br><br>I take it again.<br><br></body></html>

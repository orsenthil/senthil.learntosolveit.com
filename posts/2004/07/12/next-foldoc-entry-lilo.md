<br>Linux Loader (or Lilo)

<br>

<br>I have found a new definition.

<br>http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/workshops/linux_install/lilo.html

<br>

<br>

<br>LILO - The Linux Loader

<br>&gt;From the LILO README:

<br>

<br>LILO is a versatile boot loader for Linux.  It does not depend on a

<br>specific file system, can boot Linux kernel images from floppy disks

<br>and hard disks, and can even boot other operating systems.  One of up

<br>to sixteen differernt images can be selected at boot time.  Various

<br>parameters, such as the root device, can be set indepenantly for each

<br>kernel.  LILO can even be used as the master boot record.

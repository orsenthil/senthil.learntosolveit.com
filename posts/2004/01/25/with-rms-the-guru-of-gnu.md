<html><body><p>It was exactly the ditto of what I had read in <a href="http://www.faifzilla.org">FAIFZILLA</a>

<br>In the early and intial day ( when opensource, freesoftware,linux were same for me) I used to think of rms in comparision  with Mahatma Gandhi; one maths professor there ( at Cochi Unversity of Science and Technology) gave a breif introduction and said that he feels that rms is comparable to Mahatma Gandhi.

<br>

<br>rms closed his eyes with shyness.

<br>then he came to mike and said, well he( rms) and his movement cannot be compared with Gandhi's coz.

<br>he ( rms) does not have the courage which Gandhi  had { I clapped here} and free software movement is not yet as sucessful as Gandhi's movement was. 

<br>The sucess of the movement depends upon you ( he pointed to us in the audience).

<br>

<br>then it started with the explaination of Free Software Movement and the Gnu operating system. The ditto of the narration which you will find at faifzilla.

<br>There was a lot of Hackerish Humor in between, for eg:

<br>

<br>rms said <i>" If you know how to swim; you see a person drowning in pool and it is not bush, would not you save him ?" </i>

<br>

<br>- this was w.r.t to helping your neighbour by sharing the software which is one of the freedoms provided by free software.

<br>

<br>moving on to serious issues, rms said, " idealism is practical. The people who say that idealism is not possible, they are wrong. If you have long range goal , you either need to have an ideal or lots of money. it is because of idealism that nations like India and US exists"

<br>

<br>The speech ended with  St.iGNUcious show , every one enjoyed that with good laugh.

<br>

<br>The Q/A session followed. I had noted few points to be asked/discussed:

<br>1) About Don Hopkins.

<br>2) About MIT lab allowing rms to program and start the gnu after he had quit MIT.

<br>3) About the Teaching profession instead of waiter ( he says in his speech)

<br>4) Thanks for GNU Emacs

<br>5) About Donald Knuth and his perception of CS, which is different.

<br>6) Why not GNU HURD? Why is still not happening.

<br>7) Argentina and Germany where lots of politics had crept with software.

<br>8) Free Software having a Free Market

<br>9) BASH  - the Best Shell

<br>10) gnu c library was developed by a 17 year old - rms didnt name him in the speech, got to find links on it.

<br>11)  which search engine do you use?

<br>12) The Fun of CS is lost in preaching and politics of free software. -  <a href="http://usr.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_usr_archive.html#107470613892109469">read this thought.</a>

<br>

<br>so on.

<br>

<br>I asked by starting, which search engine do you use.

<br>

<br>rms said : none 

<br>

<br>I could not proceed further, I detailed when on cyberspace and you want to find something, which search engine do you use. 

<br>

<br>he said: I dont use any search engine, because it is software running a their computer on their server, I do not have any control on that.

<br>

<br>- but me and lot of people use a search engine.

<br>

<br>rms: its upon you, I have taken to schism of not using any proprietary software and using only free software.

<br>

<br>- by search and internet only ,I could locate information like Open course ware provided by MIT

<br>

<br>rms: opencourseware is not under free license

<br>

<br>- but they improve the life of humanity

<br>

<br>rms : yes, they improve the life of humanity,but they are not under free license.

<br>

<br>later on it became that many more questions were to be asked by audiences.

<br>

<br>Questions about HURD followed, and he said that they are technical questions and you should solve them.

<br>

<br>After having got an autograph in the GNU GPL and Free Software, Free Society Book,

<br>I continued.

<br>- Do you still have contact with Don hopkins.

<br>rms: at times.

<br>- What is he doing now.

<br>rms: I dont know.

<br>- do you think that things like WSF, will be able to combat bush things.

<br>rms: I dont know, but I am just doing it.

<br>- According to an Indian Philosophy, you need stregth to combat strength.

<br>rms: ( agreeing to Indian thought) , yes there should be more people , why not you join in.

<br>

<br>sometime later:

<br>- Hope you do more programming this year. Have fun with programming.

<br>rms: I need to talk on the free software philosiphy, I dont get time to program these days.

<br>

<br>- but you are a guru , a master programmer.

<br>rms:nodding, yes but there are lot of people programming but very few talking on these matters.

<br>

<br>- Happy Hacking. 

<br>

<br>( he was involved with signing others and later I heard some continuation on wsf ,bush which on still on his mind)

<br>

<br>----

<br>yes, it true, one will listen only if one hears about free software stuff from rms.

<br>like he practises what is says  - ( " one should be the change which he wants to see in this world")

<br>Does not use anything other than free software.

<br>

<br>I dont know much abt myself. I am not completely as per his views, but I respect rms a lot.

<br>

<br>Here are the news paper reports

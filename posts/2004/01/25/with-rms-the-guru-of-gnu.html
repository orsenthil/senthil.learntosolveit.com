<p></p>
<p>It was exactly the ditto of what I had read in <a href="http://www.faifzilla.org">FAIFZILLA</a></p>
<p><br>In the early and intial day ( when opensource, freesoftware,linux were same for me) I used to think of rms in comparision  with Mahatma Gandhi; one maths professor there ( at Cochi Unversity of Science and Technology) gave a breif introduction and said that he feels that rms is comparable to Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms closed his eyes with shyness.</p>
<p><br>then he came to mike and said, well he( rms) and his movement cannot be compared with Gandhi's coz.</p>
<p><br>he ( rms) does not have the courage which Gandhi  had { I clapped here} and free software movement is not yet as sucessful as Gandhi's movement was. </p>
<p><br>The sucess of the movement depends upon you ( he pointed to us in the audience).</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>then it started with the explaination of Free Software Movement and the Gnu operating system. The ditto of the narration which you will find at faifzilla.</p>
<p><br>There was a lot of Hackerish Humor in between, for eg:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms said <i>" If you know how to swim; you see a person drowning in pool and it is not bush, would not you save him ?" </i></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- this was w.r.t to helping your neighbour by sharing the software which is one of the freedoms provided by free software.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>moving on to serious issues, rms said, " idealism is practical. The people who say that idealism is not possible, they are wrong. If you have long range goal , you either need to have an ideal or lots of money. it is because of idealism that nations like India and US exists"</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The speech ended with  St.iGNUcious show , every one enjoyed that with good laugh.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The Q/A session followed. I had noted few points to be asked/discussed:</p>
<p><br>1) About Don Hopkins.</p>
<p><br>2) About MIT lab allowing rms to program and start the gnu after he had quit MIT.</p>
<p><br>3) About the Teaching profession instead of waiter ( he says in his speech)</p>
<p><br>4) Thanks for GNU Emacs</p>
<p><br>5) About Donald Knuth and his perception of CS, which is different.</p>
<p><br>6) Why not GNU HURD? Why is still not happening.</p>
<p><br>7) Argentina and Germany where lots of politics had crept with software.</p>
<p><br>8) Free Software having a Free Market</p>
<p><br>9) BASH  - the Best Shell</p>
<p><br>10) gnu c library was developed by a 17 year old - rms didnt name him in the speech, got to find links on it.</p>
<p><br>11)  which search engine do you use?</p>
<p><br>12) The Fun of CS is lost in preaching and politics of free software. -  <a href="http://usr.blogspot.com/2004_01_01_usr_archive.html#107470613892109469">read this thought.</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>so on.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>I asked by starting, which search engine do you use.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms said : none </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>I could not proceed further, I detailed when on cyberspace and you want to find something, which search engine do you use. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>he said: I dont use any search engine, because it is software running a their computer on their server, I do not have any control on that.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- but me and lot of people use a search engine.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms: its upon you, I have taken to schism of not using any proprietary software and using only free software.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- by search and internet only ,I could locate information like Open course ware provided by MIT</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms: opencourseware is not under free license</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- but they improve the life of humanity</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>rms : yes, they improve the life of humanity,but they are not under free license.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>later on it became that many more questions were to be asked by audiences.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Questions about HURD followed, and he said that they are technical questions and you should solve them.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>After having got an autograph in the GNU GPL and Free Software, Free Society Book,</p>
<p><br>I continued.</p>
<p><br>- Do you still have contact with Don hopkins.</p>
<p><br>rms: at times.</p>
<p><br>- What is he doing now.</p>
<p><br>rms: I dont know.</p>
<p><br>- do you think that things like WSF, will be able to combat bush things.</p>
<p><br>rms: I dont know, but I am just doing it.</p>
<p><br>- According to an Indian Philosophy, you need stregth to combat strength.</p>
<p><br>rms: ( agreeing to Indian thought) , yes there should be more people , why not you join in.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>sometime later:</p>
<p><br>- Hope you do more programming this year. Have fun with programming.</p>
<p><br>rms: I need to talk on the free software philosiphy, I dont get time to program these days.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- but you are a guru , a master programmer.</p>
<p><br>rms:nodding, yes but there are lot of people programming but very few talking on these matters.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>- Happy Hacking. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>( he was involved with signing others and later I heard some continuation on wsf ,bush which on still on his mind)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>----</p>
<p><br>yes, it true, one will listen only if one hears about free software stuff from rms.</p>
<p><br>like he practises what is says  - ( " one should be the change which he wants to see in this world")</p>
<p><br>Does not use anything other than free software.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>I dont know much abt myself. I am not completely as per his views, but I respect rms a lot.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Here are the news paper reports</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/25/stories/2004012504990400.htm"> The Hindu (1)</a></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.hindu.com/lf/2004/01/25/stories/2004012500140200.htm">The Hindu (2)</a></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/25/stories/2004012501151100.htm">The Hindu (3)</a></p>
<p><br> - this (3) one was regarding the malayalam font released on that day, I just had brief talk with the person. The person was not completely a gnu/linux one.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.hindu.com/2004/01/25/stories/2004012501131100.htm">This hindu article </a>is about Maddog visiting India at SGI premises, Matthew Scheulk having phone conversation with Prez APJ kalam and visiting India and RMS at WSF and kerala.</p>

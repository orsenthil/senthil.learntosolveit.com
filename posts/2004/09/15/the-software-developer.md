morning. {{% wikipedia article="Scott McNealy" %}}


I am not against Bill Gates the man, but he's playing a historical role that
demands a harsh critique. Within his lifetime, Bill will have probably acquired,
by accident, a kind of power that has been rarely sought and never before
achieved. The medieval popes sought to be the intermediaries for all thought and
communication, even as they were the patrons of the elite intellectuals of their
day. They serve as the best precedent we have for what is truly an unprecedented
situation. In twenty or fifty years, when most human affairs, intimate and
grand, are conducted via computer operating systems, Microsoft could become the
universal gatekeeper of thought. Microsoft has so far not been malevolent when
it has exercised editorial power. But absolute power corrupts absolutely, and
Microsoft could well end up with a new type of absolute power.{{% wikipedia article="Jaron Lanier" %}}


Bill Gates is a prime example of the power of a smart person being focused on
exactly what he wants. He accomplishes his goals while the rest of us are just
muddling around. Watching Bill operate makes me realize, for better or worse,
how unfocused I am.Danny Hills

fourth generation language

(4GL, or "report generator language") An "application specific" language, one
with built-in knowledge of an application domain, in the way that SQL has
built-in knowledge of the relational database domain.  The term was invented by
Jim Martin to refer to non-procedural high level languages built around database
systems.

Fourth generation languages are close to natural language and were built with
the concept that certain applications could be generalised by adding limited
programming ability to them.  When given a description of the data format and
the report to generate, a 4GL system produces COBOL (or other 3GL) code, that
actually reads and processes the data and formats the results.

Some examples of 4GL are: database query language e.g.SQL; Focus, Metafont,
PostScript, S, IDL-PV, WAVE, Gauss, Mathematica, and data-stream languages such
as AVS, APE, Iris Explorer.

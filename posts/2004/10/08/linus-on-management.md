Linus has written a nice article at [Linux Weekly News](https://lwn.net/Articles/105375/).

It is interesting to read, and it is about management. It is titled "Linus on
Kernel Management" and deals with management in general. He often says (I have
read him saying) that he is more of a manager for the kernel now rather than a
core developer. It goes: First off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People" and NOT reading it. Burn it; it's a great symbolic gesture.

About his article, document does not so much answer the question as it makes it
painfully obvious to the questioner that we don't have a clue what the answer
is.

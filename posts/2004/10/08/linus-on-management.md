.. description: Linus Torvalds shares his thoughts on kernel management and general management practices.

Linus has written a nice article at [Linux Weekly News](https://lwn.net/Articles/105375/).

It is interesting to read, and it is about management. It is titled "Linus on
Kernel Management" and deals with management in general. He often says (I have
read him saying) that he is more of a manager for the kernel now rather than a
core developer. It goes: First off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly
Effective People" and NOT reading it. Burn it.

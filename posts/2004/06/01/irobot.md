<br><h3> Three Laws of Robotics </h3>

<br><hr>

<br><li>A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.

<br></li><li>A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.

<br></li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.</li></body></html>

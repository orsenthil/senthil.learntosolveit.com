To you, a robot is just a robot. But you haven't worked with them. You don't
know them. They're a cleaner, better breed than we are.  When Earth is ruled by
master-machines... when robots are more human than humankind.

- Dr.Susan Calvin.

I was spellbound by the genius of Asimov, when I read his I, Robot and especially
fascinated by his Three Laws of Robotics

1. A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.
2. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.
3. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.

**operating system**

(LILO) A boot loader for Linux. LILO does not depend on a specific file system,
it can boot Linux kernel images from floppy disks and hard disks and can even
boot other operating systems. One of up to sixteen differernt images can be
selected at boot time. Various parameters, such as the root device, can be set
independently for each kernel. LILO can even be used as the master boot record.

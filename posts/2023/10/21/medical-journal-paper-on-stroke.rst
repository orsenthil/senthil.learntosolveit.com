.. type: text

This medical journal paper *Prevention of perioperative stroke in patients
undergoing non-cardiac surgery* states that stroke is preventable.

I was motivated to read this as the topic is close to my heart. I approached
and understood this paper using tools like `Fermat's Library`_, `histre` for annotation and
ChatGPT to understand medical terms.

Stroke was attributed to hypertension and an insult to psychology when patients
with hypertension were subjected to hospital care for the first time. The
prevention is possible by thickening the blood and working to reduce the hyper
tension factors.

Bram is the creator of {{% wikipedia article="Vim (text editor)" %}} software used by developers throughout the world.
He `":wq"`_ from this world on August 3rd, 2023 in his inimitable, quiet way.

Bram influenced me. The splash screen that encouraged donation to a charity
caught my attention like nothing else. Inspired by that splash screen, I started
volunteering my time and donated money to many causes that I cared about.

I once had a brief interaction with Bram. He clearly said, he didn't need any
money and encouraged all donations to causes he cared about. In one case, I had
a brief email interaction with him to facilitate a donation, and he directed it
to the Kilbale Children's Center, he volunteered with.

Thank you, Bram. Your influence will live on through the software you created
and the people you inspired.

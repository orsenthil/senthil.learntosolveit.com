My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This was a lengthy book.
The interviewers did a fantastic job with their questions and covered a range of
expert programmers and language designers across the spectrum.
The important thing I gained from reading this book was my "enthusiasm" again
for different programming languages and styles.
Each different language creator had some "opinions" about the state of affairs
and went about in a personal way to do something about it, create a language,
create a community, solve the problem, and usually building on top of what the
person had learned from others.
The language creation is both a scientific process (standing upon the shoulders
of giants), as well as the unique taste that each language designer brought to
the table.
I was excited to learn more about AWK, Haskell, Perl, and Eiffel as languages
after reading this book.

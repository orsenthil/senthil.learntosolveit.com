At the moment it is available for Georgia and Rhode Island, but I certainly see this sprouting in all other states of
US.

Tesla has a ventilator in making using the car parts. Even if this only a technical demo, I appreciate it, and the
language used in the demo was appropriate and careful for the purpose.

Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff took a 8 step pledge, and with few pledges being, *No significant layoff for next 90
days* and encouraging employees to keep their own hourly workers like gardeners, home cleaners employed with pay.
I really appreciate the social responsiblity shown by Marc.

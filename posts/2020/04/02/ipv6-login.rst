It is the year 2021, and I logged into one of my servers using IPv6 address. So far I had struggled with using IPv6
address for anything useful.  Today, I was able login to a server directly from my home using an IPv6 address.

vultr.com provides servers for USD 2.5 per month, with a *restriction* that it will only have IPv6 address.
But if you can ssh to it, why not get those cheap boxes?


```bash
$ ssh -6 root@2001:19f0:5401:129f:5400:02ff:fea8:1fde
root@meet:~#
```

We might have heard about Einstein’s Famous quote on Gandhi. Few years ago, I discovered that the quote is from a book
by Albert Einstein with Title “Essays in Humanism”

    Mahatma Gandhi

    A LEADER OF his people, unsupported by any outward authority: a politician whose success rests not upon craft nor the mastery of technical devices, but simply on the convincing power of his personality; a victorious fighter who has always scorned the use of force; a man of wisdom and humility, armed with resolve and inflexible consistency, who has devoted all his strength to the up lifting of his people and the betterment of their lot; a man who has confronted the brutality of Europe with the dignity of the simple human being, and thus at all times risen superior.

    Generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.

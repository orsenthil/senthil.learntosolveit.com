.. admonition:: Being a polymath

   Polymaths such as Da Vinci, Goethe and Benjamin Franklin were such high achievers that we might feel a bit reluctant
   to use the word ‘polymath’ to describe our own humble attempts to become multi-talented. We can’t all be geniuses.
   But we do all still indulge in polymathic activity; it’s part of what makes us human.

Bill Gates followed up with a Live Question and Answer session with TED's Chris
Anderson.

* **Testing** is the still "key part".  We need a way to find to detect who
  has-virus and who does not. This is done using swabs. *All of us, will have
  to be tested before we resume social interaction.*

* He is still very much concerned about developing countries, like India,
  Pakistan, and countries in the southern hemisphere, as he perceives, will
  have more difficulty than developed countries like the US to get this
  through.

* *Economic Impact* can be reversed, but if a life is lost, it cannot be
  brought back.

* The idea of building herd-immunity against this virus, in reality,  doesn't
  look like a choice. The numbers don't add up.

`Blown to Bits <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063035-blown-to-bits>`_ by `Hal Abelson <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1312233.Hal_Abelson>`_

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

Bits are Bit.
Even if they are transmitted through electrons in copper wires or light in fiber
optical cables or via modulation in radio waves.
All of these carry bits and run the world.
This book covers the intersection between technology, society, the justice
system, policies, and politics.
It is highly approachable and helps you appreciate technology, not just from a
technical standpoint but from a societal standpoint.
I really appreciate the concern for fellow human beings put forefront in this
book.
It opens the reader's mind to care a lot about the political process and be
aware that any technology we design is going to have a wide societal impact.

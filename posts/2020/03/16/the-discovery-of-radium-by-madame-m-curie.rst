Some interesting quotes from this book

.. admonition:: pursuit of truth

    *Then I took up measurements of minerals and I found that several of those
    which contain uranium or thorium or both were active. But then the activity
    was not what I could expect, it was greater than for uranium or thorium
    compounds like the oxides which are almost entirely composed of these
    elements. Then I thought that there should be in the minerals some unknown
    element having a much greater radioactivity than uranium or thorium. And I
    wanted to find and to separate that element, and I settled to that work
    with Professor Curie. We thought it would be done in several weeks or
    months, but it was not so. It took many years of hard work to finish that
    task. There was not one new element, there were several of them. But the
    most important is radium which could be separated in a pure state.*

.. admonition:: work of science

   *But we must not forget that when radium was discovered no one knew that it
   would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this
   is a proof that scientific 5 work must not be considered from the point of
   view of the direct usefulness of it. It must be done for itself, for the
   beauty of science, and then there is always the chance that a scientific
   discovery may become like the radium a benefit for humanity.*

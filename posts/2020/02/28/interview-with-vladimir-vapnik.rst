This was an unbelievable interview with `Vladimir Vapnik`_. He is the co-inventor of Support Vector Machines, one of
widely used statistical machine learning algorithm. In explaining his understanding of the world, he uses the
mathematical terms of predicate and functions.

He often went back to `Vladimir Propp`_ to 31 functions that explained russian folk tales.

Vladmir Vapnik is a truly a humble, honest, accurate person, trying to *understand* and then solve a well defined
problem of Hand-writing recognition, within his lifetime. I was amazed while listening to him.

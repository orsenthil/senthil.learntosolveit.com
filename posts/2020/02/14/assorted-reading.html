<p class="last">I see choosing "new" languages (or frameworks) as very risky propositions to
the life of a project. These languages are less likely to be around in ten or
twenty years time (newer and better Rusts and Gos are likely to form in the
years ahead) and in the meantime require you to constantly expend effort to
prevent your projects from being turned into a brick by
language/environment/library changes. In contrast my old C projects from 5-8
years ago still compile and run, with one particular example only needing a
small modification. It's not perfect, but C is much more likely to be the
"safe" option if time x usefulness of your project is a goal.</p>
</div>
<p>Argues that we spend time quickly adopting new languages and frameworks, take it for granted that anything we write
will be short-lived. Author argues that it is wrong philosophy to adopt, and I agree with him.</p>
<p>Choose to experiment, but build something that lasts.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-rsa-compromise">
<p class="first admonition-title">rsa compromise</p>
<p>It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.</p>
<p>The better alternatives include:</p>
<p>The RFC8332 RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
"ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
client and server support them.</p>
<p>The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
OpenSSH since release 6.5.</p>
<p class="last">The RFC5656 ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.</p>
</div>
<p>We definitely need a better name for these algorithms. RSA, the term, is so much easier to remember and associate than
SHA-2, ED25519, and ECDSA.</p>

<div class="admonition admonition-once-a-mathematician-always-a-mathematician">
<p class="first admonition-title">once a mathematician, always a mathematician</p>
<p>At its heart, mathematics is about understanding the underlying structure
inherent in a given area of interest —and where no such structure exists —to
deﬁne the minimal structure that is needed to make forward progress.</p>
<p>The phases involved in the creative process were ﬁrst described by German
physiologist Herman Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century. He identiﬁed
three stages of creativity:</p>
<p>saturation,
incubation and
illumination</p>
<p class="last">These three stages have since been augmented with the additional step of
veriﬁcation by the scientiﬁc community.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition admonition-mathematical-techniques-are-algorithms">
<p class="first admonition-title">mathematical techniques are algorithms</p>
<p>Speciﬁc mathematical techniques e.g., differentiation, integration or the
Simplex method are algorithms.</p>
<ol class="last arabic simple">
<li>To truly appreciate an algorithm and understand how it works, one needs to
be able to run it by hand on a representative set of examples.</li>
<li>In mathematics, this translates to being able to differentiate or integrate
a given expression.</li>
<li>The latter requires a set of semi-mechanical steps and this is where one
uses aids such as scratch memory provided by pencil and paper —something for
which I needed to compensate.</li>
<li>However, a true understanding of the underlying algorithm is far more
important than any speciﬁc technique that one might devise for running the
algorithm on speciﬁc instances.</li>
</ol>

<p>I could relate to author's experience in solving some problems.</p>
<p>1. Finding the day of the week. I went by the logic that, 1st January of 1900 was a Monday, and then I figured out
hte day of the week. This problem was given in the book, Let us C, by Yashwant Kanetkar.</p>
<p>2. Playing a nimm like game. I had a designed a similar game called 21-match stick game in the college. It was a very
simple game, wherein the player forced to pick the last match stick looses. This was again from the exercise in the
Yashwant Kanetkar book.</p>
<p>As I recollect, I think, I had a good saturation phase in reading the "Let us C" book by reading, reviewing.
Incubation by trial and errors, and development of the game itself was illumninatiom and when I let my friends play
it, it was the verification stage.</p>

I had supported this project called `"Modeling Is Key to Understand Processes, Structures and Scales!"`_ by Mrs.
Sexton of Montevideo Elementary School for the fifth graders. They had this project going on for the family science
night in the winter of 2019.

On my birthday this year, I received a `ton of thank you notes`_ for the supporting this project. It felt amazing to
see so many handwritten cards!

Thanks to students, and the teacher for this gesture. I will support your science efforts anytime! :)

I cleared the CKAD exam.

I took 3 attempts to clear this exam. In my first attemp, I had forgotten the concepts.
I was not very confident during 2nd, and prepared well for the 3rd attempt to clear it.

I read "Kubernetes from Ground Up" again. Practised and "understood" the concepts better.
With all these, the tests were actually very enjoyable.

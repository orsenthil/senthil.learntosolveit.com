`The Manga Guide to Calculus <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309077-the-manga-guide-to-calculus>`_ by `Hiroyuki Kojima <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2865700.Hiroyuki_Kojima>`_

My rating: 2 of 5 stars

I tried to pick up some high-level intuition on the basics of calculus with this
book, but I failed.
Unlike, other Manga guides on electricity, and linear algebra, I found this book
not very strong on the plot and I felt it did not present the story in a
cohesive manner.
The concepts were introduced randomly, and I could not see how one built upon
the previously introduced concept.
On the positive note, it did introduce very basics of calculus well, and I am
eager to pick up other books on calculus with that foundation.

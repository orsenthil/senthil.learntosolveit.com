by `Jules Verne <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/696805.Jules_Verne>`_

My rating: `5 of 5 stars <https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003926912>`_

This is a science-fiction adventure book. If you are a science-fiction fan like
me, then you are in for a treat reading this book.

I really loved this book and the narration. It started as a simple story but
quickly turned into an adventure plot, and before I realized it, excellent
science was mixed into every element of this fictitious story. It has references
to Fourier and Poisson, calculations for measuring distances based on sound lag,
adventures of an Icelandic hiker, a cave explorer, a climber, and even
biologists encountering a trilobite! Yes, a trilobite! You will also find all
the pre-historic animals and references to famous explorers, biologists, and
taxonomists—all present in a single story.

When I chose the book and read the plot, I wondered, "How is this possible?" But
when I read it, I was taken on a real adventure by the author.

I read this book in the "Kindle-In-Motion" format, and the illustrator, Killian
Eng, is in a class of his own. He did excellent work and did justice to Jules
Verne's timeless work.

Here are some of my notes and highlights from this book:

Here is something about Fourier:

    Was it not always believed until Fourier that the temperature of the
    interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually?

About Poisson:

    “Well, I will tell you that true savants, among them Poisson, have
    demonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees existed in the interior of
    the globe.”

A {{% wikipedia article="Trilobite" %}}!

    "Very well," said he quietly, "it is the shell of a crustacean, of an
    extinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more."

All these pre-historic animals:

    leptotheria, mericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons,
    protopitheci, pterodactyls, and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled
    together for his special satisfaction.

And the adventurers:

    "Mr. Milne-Edwards! Ah! Mr. de Quatrefages, how I wish you were standing
    here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock!"

This book was a thorough adventure, with so many references to explore further!

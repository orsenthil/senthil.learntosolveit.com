`Sita's Ramayana <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11097473-sita-s-ramayana>`_ by `Samhita Arni <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/342139.Samhita_Arni>`_

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

I really enjoyed reading Samhita Arni's take on Ramayana, Sita's Ramayana, the
story of Ramayana entirely narrated by Sita.
It gives a new perspective to the entire story, while not-at-all deviating from
the plot and details of the story.
As a reader who is familiar with the story, I picked up this book with a notion
of what I can expect.
However, I was still surprised and thoroughly enjoyed reading this story
presented by an excellent writer (Samhita) and a fantastic illustration (Moyna
Chitrakar).
Following this book, I became eager to check out other works of this author, and
I found that her writings bring a freshness to the Indian mythology genre, and I
am highly eager to read her next work "The Prince".

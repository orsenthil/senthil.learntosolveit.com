.. description: A reflection on Rabindranath Tagore's poem capturing the emotional dialogue between Karna and Kunti from the Mahabharata.

I came across a translated work of Rabindranath Tagore's Poem: `Dialogue Between Karna and Kunti`_
The poem, even the translation captures the emotions between Karna and Kunti very well. We all know about this
episode of Mahabharata. In every critical interaction, Karna comes out as a highly ethical character.

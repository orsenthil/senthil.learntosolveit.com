If your child, between age kindergarten to 3rd grade is interested in Learning
Minecraft, we have a new club called "Occamy Minecraft Club".  The classes are
taught by my Son, Siddhartha, and kids learning from other kids usually well.  I
am there to make sure all children learn well from each other during the class.

It is USD 5/- per class, limited to only 5 students per class. Age range kindergarten to 3rd grade.

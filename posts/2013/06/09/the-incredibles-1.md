<html><body><p>Every once in a while you come across some amazing and something insanely creative by unknown folks in the internet. I have decided to capture those moments by title "The Incredibles" series.

Today, it happened to me. After doing a basic drawing tutorial at Khan Academy I saw a spin off program which I thought is a image loaded. I wondered why some one spun off a simple drawing tutorial and then loaded image for practice. But I was wrong. This whole image was drawn using rects and fill.



See it for yourself. The Incredibles super hero of this creation is to Mr. <a href="http://www.petercollingridge.co.uk/">Peter Collingridge</a>

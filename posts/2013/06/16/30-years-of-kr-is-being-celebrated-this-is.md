30 years of K&amp;R is being celebrated.



This is an important book our life time and Inform IT has an article on "<a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138913">Leading Programmers Remember the Impact of The C Programming Language</a>"



Roughly around <a href="http://sarovar.org/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/CVSROOT/?cvsroot=uthcode">10 years ago</a> to get myself into Software Development, I <a href="http://www.uthcode.com/cprogramming.html">started solving all the problems</a> at the end of the K&amp;R book and bootstrapped my Project <a href="http://www.uthcode.com">Uthcode</a> for the third time.  I can safely say that it turned out be successful and I owe greatly to this one book.



Later when I started <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/python/contributors/111669178856">contributing to Python</a>, I focussed mostly on Python and standard library which is written in Python.  Noticing how other programmers went about with CPython core, I wanted to re-read it to get into K&amp;R get into implementation and design. That has not happened yet, but I am planning for it sometime soonish. I can get back and rely on K&amp;R, plus I will have my experience to draw upon.</body></html>

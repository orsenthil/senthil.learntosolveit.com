I think, this is going off the limits and being explicitly evil.

When it comes to shared endorsements in ads, you can control the use of your
Profile name and photo via the Shared Endorsements setting. If you turn the
setting to “off,” your Profile name and photo will not show up on that ad for
your favorite bakery or any other ads.

Isn't it crazy that you are using it in the first place without me allowing or
endorsing?

> It looks like they're only going to use it for products you've endorsed
(+1'd).  Kind of, ahem, like a certain microblog service that tells me which of
my friends follow the tweeter of that promoted tweet I'm looking at.

> I realized that. :-) I got emotional thinking that Google was doing it for the
whole web (adwords) instead of it being "in-network" endorsement (FB/ Twitter).
I bet, if the later two got any benefit from doing outside their networks, they
would do it too. And I hate them all.

> It's good that Google is providing an opt-out, but dislike the idea of
including one by default in changed ToC and then providing an option to opt-out.

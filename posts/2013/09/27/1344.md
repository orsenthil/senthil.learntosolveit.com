James Lovell, John Swigert and Fred Haise. 



 



Apollo 13 was the third intended moon mission which actually failed on land on moon. The feat was to bring the astronauts back alive to earth and the team on earth managed it by propelling the shuttle to a free-fall on pacific ocean.



It was classed as "successful failure".

</p><p>Richard M Stallman talks about it. I wholeheartedly agree with his claim. Programming is a craft, not a science, it cannot and should not been seen as academic exercise, like reading books, solving problems from scratch and feeling complete, but programming should help you build something, contribute to building of something, like you can contribute to an existing Free Software.

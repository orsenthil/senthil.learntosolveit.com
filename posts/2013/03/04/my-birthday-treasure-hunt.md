Looks like it! I saw a small paper inside.



Oops. This is not used for Sambar.



This is the dal, which has slightly bigger dal grains which is used for sambar. Hurray! found it.



It's the lamp. How simple!!



I opened the lamp to find the next clue.



Who are those celestial siblings?



That's Senthil Kumaran (the other one.) and Mr. Ganapathy Babba!



That's my favorite dialogue from Kamal movie. So it should be inside a Kamal movie cover!



I walked 6 foot and found this cover near the TV. Hurray! :)

<html><body><p>Since I like CS and I have not really cracked the Subject Test, I wanted give it a try again. Then I thought I will go through all the aduni.org videos that I have not watched and I have always wanted to watch. Then my thoughts lead me to stuff like topcoder, which I have not competed in for a while and trying to improving my ranking.</p><p>But at last, when clearing my Python emails, I saw so much of pending work that has accumulated that I want to work only on Python in a planned manner and not on anything else.</p></body></html>

Good work requires a significant amount of dedicated time, even in areas where you have expertise.

I reflected on this as I am currently taking an [intermediate Python
course](https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-003/) online with my friend
Avinash. Since I am already familiar with the concepts, I often skip the
lectures and dive straight into the exercises and quizzes. Each week, we are
tasked with completing a mini-project. I usually allocate just enough time to
finish the project and, more importantly, muster just enough motivation to meet
the deadline.

During the Pong game project, I scored two points less in peer evaluation
compared to others, even though I had given full credit to my peers. This made
me question why I received a lower score. Upon reflection, I realized that I
lacked the patience to fully polish the project to meet everyone's expectations,
despite being fully capable of doing so.

This was quite a realization. Itâ€™s clear that I need to work on this and strive
to improve.

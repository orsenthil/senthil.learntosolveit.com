This book is about Amazon. I read this quickly to see the phrases used

This book is about American Farming. I couldn't complete reading it as
it is a lengthy one, but the premise was America needs to take care of
farming as a personal profession which people can care about. The
mechanization has led to "unsettling of America" is the point of the book. I
took this upon recommendation from Mr.Sridhar Venbu in a tweet.

Measuring something for measurement's sake, a pointless activity as we
don't know or define why, is the tyranny of metric. The premise of this
book is how obssession with quantitive metrics is misleading.

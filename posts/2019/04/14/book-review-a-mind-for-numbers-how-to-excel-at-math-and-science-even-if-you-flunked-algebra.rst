My rating: 5 of 5 stars

Like most readers, I stumbled upon this book after taking Barbara Oakley's
Learning How to Learn Course in Coursera.
This book reinforces the concepts taught in that course.
The idea of relaxed learning, giving ourselves plenty of time while learning
difficult concepts, avoiding procrastination, and tools that help us avoid the
procrastination.
The idea of repetition for remembering different concepts is presented and
stressed well this book.
The importance of sleep for learning stayed with me and changed me when I took
the course based on this book.
I never discount sleep for important exams or deadlines now.
The crux of learning is expressed well by this quote from Santiago Ramón y Cajal
introduced to us in this book What a wonderful stimulant it would be for the
beginner if his instructor, instead of amazing and dismaying him with the
sublimity of great past achievements, would reveal instead the origin of each
scientific discovery, the series of errors and missteps that preceded it -
information that, from a human perspective, is essential to an accurate
explanation of discovery.
- Santiago Ramón y Cajal

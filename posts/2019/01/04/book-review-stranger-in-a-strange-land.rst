.. description: A review of the science fiction classic "Stranger in a Strange Land" by Robert A. Heinlein.

{{% wikipedia article="Stranger in a Strange Land" %}}. Wow, what a book. It
goes into multiple topics like being human, politics, religion, love, sex,
community, spirituality, entrepreneurship, money, influence, negotiation,
strategy and "understanding" of it all.

This gave a new word {{% wikipedia article="Grok" %}} to English speaking people, which roughly means to
"understand thoroughly" and becoming one with the concept.

One interesting thing about this science fiction is, it combined the real world
concepts of business, stocks, politics, and ownership with an imaginary
situation where humans have already traveled to Mars and there is a human raised
by Martians among us. The details covering the rise of Mike to the status of a
godman, and formation of his communion was a fun read.

Just imagine how close is this quote "Thou art god, I am god. All that groks is
god.” by Valentine Michael Smith to the Sanskrit Verse {{% wikipedia article="Mahāvākyas" text="Tat Tvam Asi" %}}.

The character Jubal Harshaw attributes that one can explain away everything by
holding on to {{% wikipedia article="Solipsism" %}} and {{% wikipedia article="Pantheism" %}} .

I was impressed with {{% wikipedia article="Robert Heinlein" %}} covering so many topics. I really enjoyed it.

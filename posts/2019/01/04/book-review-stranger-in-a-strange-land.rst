  My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2652356341">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
  Wow, what a book. It goes into multiple topics like being human, politics, religion, love, sex, community, spirituality, entrepreneurship, money, influence, negotiation, strategy and "understanding" of it all.<br /><br />This gave a new word "grok" to English speaking people, which roughly means to "understand thoroughly" and becoming one with the concept.<br /><br />One interesting thing about this science fiction is, it combined the real world concepts of business, stocks, politics, and ownership with imaginary situation where humans have already traveled to mars and there human of raised by martian among us. The details covering the rise of Mike to the status of a godman, and formation of his communion was fun read.<br /><br />Just imagine how close is this quote "Thou art god, I am god. All that groks is god.‚Äù by Valentine Michael Smith to Sanskrit Verse "Tat Tvam Asi". <br /><br />The character Jubal Harshaw, attributes that one can explain away everything by holding on solipsism, and pantheism.<br /><br />I was impressed with Robert Heinlein covering so many topics. I really enjoyed it.<br />

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This book covers a great deal on political leadership and helps the reader to
understand the political landscape of multiple nations.
The crux of this, it is not a strong leader that brings a net positive change,
but a leader who is flexible, who understands the situation well, goes into the
details, establishes that the processes, and follows it through that will bring
the net positive change.
The way, the different leaders have accomplished is quite varied, and depends on
the situation and the time.
This book introduces some amazing real life characters like, Adolfo Su√°rez of
spain who transformed the country to Democracy from the previously established
monarchy in a peaceful manner.
It also shares how Deng Xioping is the person behind the economic advancement of
China from 1970 onward.
It shares the perspective on how Fidel Castro overthrew the dictatorship in his
country, and how lived by his principles, and did not accumulate any wealth for
himself.
One thing that struck with me, when this book was written, Obama was the
president of USA, and even then, the system in place in USA was such that, no
one particular person was ultimately responsible everything in the government.
It has been understood that answer for "who controls the whitehouse of USA",
seems " no one knows".
This is not a snarky comment, but a statement that workings of the government in
USA is very complex, and there are multiple forces in effect at any time,
including political parties, supporters, lobbyists, and corporations with
interests, and it will be too much to give credit and put focus on a single
person.
This book covers lot.
It covers Britain, USA, Europe, South America, South Africa, China, Russia,
touches upon New-Zealand, India and other nations.
The author explores how various leaders in these countries have shaped the
political landscapes of these places for better.

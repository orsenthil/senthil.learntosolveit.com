I tried this `codeforces problem contest/1189/problem/A`_. Trying a contest problem after many years and I thought,
it was a problem either with Dynamic Programming or with Recursion.

Turned out be a much much simpler one, that if a person reads the problem carefully and understands the scope of the solution,
the solution can be written in < 2 minutes.

I spent 30 minutes unsuccessfully. Lack of experience shows up if you don't practice.

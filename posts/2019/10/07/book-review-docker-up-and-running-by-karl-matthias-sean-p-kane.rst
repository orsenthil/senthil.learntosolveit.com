My rating: 3 of 5 stars

I picked this book to gain some structured knowledge of docker.
I had done a costly mistake with docker, and I realized, it was because my
knowledge of docker was mostly by trial and error, reading the docs and trying
it out.
The book focusses on operational aspects of docker.
This is perhaps aimed at the beginners of docker who want to pick and learn the
commands.
Experienced users might find that this book goes more into breadth than depth.

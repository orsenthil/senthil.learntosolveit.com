    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003905449">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    This book explained the concepts behind Kubernetes well. It just did keep itself at the level of a book for an operator of Kubernetes and went into explaining what is happening underneath quite well.<br />

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

This book is a straightforward narration by Georgia Takei of a Japanese
Internment by the US Government during World War II.
George and his family had suffered this cruelty.
He highlights how opportunistic senators took chances to rise to power by
promoting racial discrimination.
I had not known about this part of US history.
I also did not know how ACLU helped the Japenese in the US then.
US had detained 250,000 Japanese families living in the US, many of them US
citizens, into camps during WWII.
Having lived through this horror, a lot of these Japanese families restarted and
rebuilt their lives again.
George Takei turned to activism to share his story with the masses, and I think
he has been very effective.
This book has come the right time when similar mistreatment is being carried out
by certain opportunistic politicians.

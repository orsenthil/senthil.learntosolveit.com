    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003892657">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    This book is a straightforward narration by Georgia Takei of a Japanese Internment by the US Government during World War II. George and his family had suffered this cruelty. He highlights how opportunistic senators took chances to rise to power by promoting racial discrimination.<br /><br />I had not known about this part of US history. I also did not know how ACLU helped the Japenese in the US then. US had detained 250,000 Japanese families living in the US, many of them US citizens, into camps during WWII.<br /><br />Having lived through this horror, a lot of these Japanese families restarted and rebuilt their lives again. George Takei turned to activism to share his story with the masses, and I think he has been very effective.<br /><br />This book has come the right time when similar mistreatment is being carried out by certain opportunistic politicians.

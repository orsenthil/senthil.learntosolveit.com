After watching Infinity War at a friends home, I became immensely curious and interested
in watching all the related movies. Thor taking the power of the dying star etched in my mind
from the Infinity War. I looked up the order to watch the entire series and before
watching the Avengers: End Game, my family and I decided to watch the entire 21 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
We finished our MCU movie watching adventure finally watching with EndGame on 21st May, 2019.

It was a treat to imagination, and a pleasure follow this saga along!

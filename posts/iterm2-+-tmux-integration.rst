iTerm2 is the preferred terminal application for many on Mac. I had heard that it has tmux integration but never really
got what it is.

Simple way to get started is

::

    1. login to remote (this server should have tmux installed).
    2. tmux -CC

That's it. You will be opening a new iTerm2 terminal locally on your mac, can split, open new tabs etc with the same
connection.

This is useful.

href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6143">Harry Lorayne</a><br>

My rating: <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1301019129">5 of 5 stars</a>

<br><br>

Our brain and memory works in an associative manner. Author of this book stresses upon this point
and gives good tools to create a associations for everything that we will like to remember.H is
consiciously driving the reader to make associations and explaining the fact that "applying your
mind" to something essentially means creating association.



I applied these techniques and found my joy in remembering new things and programming my mind.

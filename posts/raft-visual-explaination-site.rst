Came across this website http://thesecretlivesofdata.com/raft/ that wonderfully explains raft consesus protocol. It's
 entertaining to follow.

I think, when trying to understand these algorithms trying to implement them is the only way to "get it".

As this article titled `Students' Guide to Raft`_  notes


    Inevitably, the first iteration of your Raft implementation will be buggy. So will the second. And third. And fourth. In general, each one will be less buggy than the previous one, and, from experience, most of your bugs will be a result of not faithfully following Figure 2.

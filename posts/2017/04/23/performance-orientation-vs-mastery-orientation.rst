.. description: Exploring the differences between performance orientation and mastery orientation, and their impact on learning and personal growth.
.. type: text

On the topic of learning, it is widely recognized that "mastery orientation" is
more effective than "performance orientation." Mastery orientation involves
doing something because you genuinely want to learn or improve, rather than to
prove your abilities to others. The focus is on personal growth and
self-improvement. This is the essence of mastery-based learning.

A memorable example of this concept can be found in the final dialogue from the movie *The Karate Kid*:

**Mr. Han:** Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why? Why do you need to go back out there so badly?

**Dre Parker:** Because I'm still scared. And no matter what happens tonight, when I leave, I don't want to be scared anymore.

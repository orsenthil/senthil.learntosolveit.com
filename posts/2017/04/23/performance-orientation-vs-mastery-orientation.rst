.. description: Exploring the differences between performance orientation and mastery orientation, and their impact on learning and personal growth.
.. type: text

On the topic of learning, it is widely recognized that "mastery orientation" is
more effective than "performance orientation." Mastery orientation involves
doing something because you genuinely want to learn or improve, rather than to
prove your abilities to others. The focus is on personal growth and
self-improvement. This is the essence of mastery-based learning.

A memorable example of this concept can be found in the final dialogue from the movie *The Karate Kid*:

**Mr. Han:** Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why? Why do you need to go back out there so badly?

**Dre Parker:** Because I'm still scared. And no matter what happens tonight, when I leave, I don't want to be scared anymore.

This dialogue highlights the importance of overcoming personal fears and
challenges for self-growth, rather than seeking external validation.

I also came across an insightful article titled ["Awesome By Proxy: Addicted to Fake Achievement"](http://www.pixelpoppers.com/2009/11/awesome-by-proxy-addicted-to-fake.html).
The author reflects on how they were choosing games that provided a false sense
of achievement and how they decided to change their approach after
introspection.

> We humans are remarkably adept at finding ways to lie to ourselves, and ways to be self-destructive.

This quote serves as a reminder to critically evaluate our actions and
motivations, ensuring they align with genuine growth and learning.

Mastery orientation encourages us to focus on the journey of learning and
self-improvement, rather than being fixated on external rewards or recognition.

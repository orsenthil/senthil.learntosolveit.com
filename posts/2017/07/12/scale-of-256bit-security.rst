.. type: text

This video, titled How Security is 256-bit Security, provides an intuitive
understanding of the immense scale of 256-bit security. The discussion is framed
in the context of {{% wikipedia article="Bitcoin" text="Bitcoin" %}}, which uses the
{{% wikipedia article="SHA-256" %}} cryptographic algorithm. Other cryptocurrencies,
or alt-coins, may use different cryptographic algorithms, but the principles of
scale and security remain relevant.

The video helps to conceptualize the robustness of 256-bit encryption,
emphasizing its importance in securing digital assets and communications in the
modern world.

I like this anarchist movement of digital crypto-currency. People are betting on algorithms!

I spent time looking around and found that I liked z.cash, the concept of mining with hashpowers and effort
that has gone into setting up cloud mining companies like genesis-mining.com and exchanges like kraken.com.

Trying with coindesk.com seems only like an entry point to this **messy world**.

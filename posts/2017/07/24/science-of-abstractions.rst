Fundamentally, computer science is a science of abstraction — creating the right model for thinking about a problem and devising
the appropriate mechanizable techniques to solve it. - From a `Ullman book`_.

Abstraction is not a complex concept. And abstraction in the sense we use it implies simplification, the
replacement of a complex and detailed real-world situation by an understandable model within which we
can solve a problem. That is, we “abstract away” the details whose effect on the solution to a problem
is minimal or nonexistent, thereby creating a model that lets us deal with the essence of the problem.

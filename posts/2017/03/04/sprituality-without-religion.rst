Read a brian pickings article titled `Neuroscientist Sam Harris on Happiness, Spirituality Without Religion, and How to Cultivate the Art of Presence`_

and happy with the self. That feeling is described using a loaded word called "spirituality" and

a person is honest with his thoughts, feelings and happy for the present moment.

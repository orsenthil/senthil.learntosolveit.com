I might have stumbled upon this via hackernews and this topic is of perennial interest to me. The general advice
given were helpful. I liked the specific, measurable suggestions too. These were:

* Learn C  - *I know C. I have written C. I will need to get back to writing in C.*
* Write a compiler  - *Not yet.*
* Learn macros - *Not yet.*
* SICP - *Not yet.*
* Understand continuations - *Not yet.*
* If anything, just try a new language - *I try this every now and then. The emphasis on his post were learning functional languages which, I think, I will be starting this year.*

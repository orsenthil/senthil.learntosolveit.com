.. description: A simple and intuitive explanation of blockchain concepts, including hashing, blocks, signatures, and distributed ledgers.
.. type: text

https://github.com/anders94/blockchain-demo is the simplest and most intuitive
explanation of blockchain that I have come across so far.  In the very short
YouTube video, the author guides us through starting with a hashing function, a
block, the concept of a signature in the block, then a blockchain, a distributed
blockchain, the concept of immutability in the blockchain and the distributed
blockchain, recording transactions in the blockchain, and verifying transactions
in the blockchain.

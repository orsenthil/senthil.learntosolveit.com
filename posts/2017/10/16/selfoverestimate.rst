.. description: Reflections on overestimating one's abilities, with a quote from Philip Greenspun.
.. type: text

This seems like a typical my-thing. I've fallen into this trap many times. It
looks people in my profession fall prey to this too.

That’s one reason I don’t miss IT, because programmers are very unlikable
people… In aviation, for example, people who greatly overestimate their level of
skill are all dead. - Philip Greenspun, co-founder of ArsDigita, excerpted from
Founders at Work.

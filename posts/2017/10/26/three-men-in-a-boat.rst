    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2164386929">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
    Funny writing. Made me chuckle at times and was very imaginative. makes for a light hearted reading.

I started reading this book using a hardcopy that I had for long time. For convenience, I quickly finished by reading the online ebook at `Project Gutenberg`_ . Since I read fast, I did't enjoy this very much. Won't discuss this much.

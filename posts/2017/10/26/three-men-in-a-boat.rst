`Three Men in a Boat <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4921.Three_Men_in_a_Boat>`_ by `Jerome K. Jerome <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3352.Jerome_K_Jerome>`_

My rating: 4 of 5 stars

Funny writing.
Made me chuckle at times and was very imaginative.
makes for a light hearted reading.



I started reading this book using a hardcopy that I had for long time. For convenience, I quickly finished by reading the online ebook at `Project Gutenberg`_ . Since I read fast, I did't enjoy this very much. Won't discuss this much.

`The Stars Like Dust <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41822.The_Stars_Like_Dust>`_ by `Isaac Asimov <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16667.Isaac_Asimov>`_

My rating: 4 of 5 stars

This book belongs to the genre of Space-opera.
Plenty of drama, plot twists, hero, heroine and plot twist.
I think, I read it twice, and I enjoyed the book when I read it the second time.

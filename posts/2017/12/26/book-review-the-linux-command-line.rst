by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4949703.William_E_Shotts_Jr_">William E. Shotts Jr.</a><br/>

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2226561998">4 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. <br /><br />This book might be a quick, due to
glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.<br />

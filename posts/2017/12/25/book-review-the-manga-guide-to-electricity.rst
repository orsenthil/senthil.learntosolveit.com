`The Manga Guide to Electricity <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6251828-the-manga-guide-to-electricity>`_ by `Kazuhiro Fujitaki <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2843859.Kazuhiro_Fujitaki>`_







    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
    had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
    will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
    voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
    that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
    working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
    Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
    involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

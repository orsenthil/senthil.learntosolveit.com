    by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9226.William_Gibson">William Gibson</a><br/>

    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2225014421">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
    like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
    couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
    from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
    this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.

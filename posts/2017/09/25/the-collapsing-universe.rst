`The Collapsing Universe <https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1290985.The_Collapsing_Universe>`_ by `Isaac Asimov <https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16667.Isaac_Asimov>`_

My rating: 5 of 5 stars

The Good Doctor once again explains Cosmology in lucid terms.
He starts off with simple premises, known facts, composes and slowly leads up to
higher concepts, ultimately leading to the concept of "Black Hole".
The book had a "trill" factor to it, as we discover the nature of black holes
and what constitutes a black hole and how the universe might have formed.
I was "wow"ed by this book.



Some exciting learning here with this book. I learnt about the following:

* {{% wikipedia article="Cygnus_X-1" %}}
* https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/chandra/multimedia/cygnusx1.html
* {{% wikipedia article="Chandra_X-ray_Observatory" %}}
* {{% wikipedia article="Schwarzschild_radius" %}}
* {{% wikipedia article="Karl_Schwarzschild" %}}

Intelligent Machines won't make us obsolete, **but our complacency might.**

That's what `Garry Kasporov`_ has to say about embracing AI.

**Our complacency might make us obsolete** may be applicable well beyond AI. It has been the death knell for kings,
empires, tribes and people. AI seems to be adding only another parameter to death by complacency.

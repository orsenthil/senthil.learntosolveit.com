    by <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4040962.Greg_McKeown">Greg McKeown</a><br/>

    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1992638097">3 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    The essence of this book is "Prioritize the activities that you are planning to do, do the most
    important ones properly.". By spreading thin, we waste our time, energy and don't complete activities
    to our satisfaction too. This message is drilled down the reader using multiple examples and anecdotes
    from successful businesses and business leaders. Excellent message, I admire it. The book was long
    for this simple message. I would have loved it more if the book was cut-down to 1/10 of its size.

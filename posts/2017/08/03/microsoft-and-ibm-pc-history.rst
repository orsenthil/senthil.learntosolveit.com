No matter how many times I read this story, it never gets boring to me. I finished reading a two part article on
Microsoft and IBM PC history featured in Ars Technica UK.

If you are programmer working in this industry, go ahead and consume those pieces. You will turn out a bit more
enlightened at the end.

    My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2194026318">5 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />

    I found this book fascinating. It provided me a window to glimpse at the history of humankind's inventions,
    inventors, and discoverers. The aspect that I liked the most was to do with things that I didn't know about
    or with the aspects that I had overlooked in the inventions. <br />For e.g. Invention of Rudder played a major
    role in navigation, the invention of multiple other devices, funding from the king that helped made Columbus's
    journey possible. Modern printing press's invention was for printing Bible. English first came to the US to occupy
    the lands in the Longitude 77, that had significance in John Dee's calendar. The Hindu Arabic numeral system
    that contributed greatly to the numerous advances in the western world and thinking. Drawing the connections
    between the inventions and context of these inventions were equally captivating as the invention itself.

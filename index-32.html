<p>I was reading the paper on <a class="reference external" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf">Dominant Resource Fairness</a> and found it approachable, interesting and fairly easy to
understand.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf">Dominant Resource Fairness</a> is a resource allocation strategy used by a system like <a class="reference external" href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a>.</p>
<p>In general terms, resources are basically things that a group will need and the idea is the allocate the resources
amongst the members of the group in an efficient way. Examples could be the amount of money (resource) to be
distributed across a group of people in the community or the processor cores in a multi-core processor that needs to be
distributed and allocated to the process running on that processor.</p>
<p>The Dominant Resource Fairness uses <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">Linear Programming</a> technique to solve the problem of resource sharing.</p>
<p>In a datacenter with multiple computers, having multiple CPUs, multiple memories, network cards and many other resources,
those needs to be shared across the processes that are running in the datacenter. DRF uses the concept of a dominant
resource. The Dominant share is the maximum share that an entity (process) has been allocated for any resource. For
e.g, if if a process A has heavy CPU usage and process B has heavy memory usage, the dominant resource for process A is
CPU and the dominant resource for process B is Memory.</p>
<p>Dominant Resource Fairness seeks to maximize the minimum dominant share across all entities. That's the formulation
for the linear programming problem for you. Doing it across in a distributed way for different tasks with different
requirements is the challenge that is being solved.</p>
<p>For example, if user A runs CPU-heavy tasks and user B runs memory-heavy tasks, the DRF attempts to equalize CPU share
of user A with the memory share of user B. In this case, the DRF would allocate more CPU and less memory to the tasks
run by user A, and allocate less CPU and more memory to the tasks run by user B. In the single resource case -- where
all jobs are requesting the same resources -- the DRF reduces to max-min fairness for that resource.</p>
<p>Some interesting anecdotes I found in the paper include, enforcing "fairness" in resource sharing is a difficult
problem by itself.</p>
<blockquote>
A big search company provided dedicated machines for jobs only if the users could guarantee high utilization. The
company soon found that users would sprinkle their code with infinite loops to artificially inflate utilization
levels.</blockquote>
<p>The paper also quoted economic research on difficultly in ensuring fairness.</p>
<blockquote>
Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI), a popular fair allocation policy preferred in the micro-economic
domain is not strategy proof.</blockquote>

<p>After learning to program in C language, the next best thing to attempt will be writing some small utility in C.
I landed upon a great tutorial (<a class="reference external" href="https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/">https://brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/</a>) that taught how to write a shell with some builtin utilities in C. I <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orsenthil/simple-shell">tried</a> that tutorial today and saw how to build a shell.</p>
<p>That's the best way to learn about the init, fork, parent process, child process and the shell loop itself.
As a side-effect, I also setup and used <a class="reference external" href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>  on my computer.</p>

<p>I am a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xtoinfinity.com/output/categories/knuth.html">Donald Knuth fan</a>, and sometimes I strive to understand his <a class="reference external" href="http://www.xtoinfinity.com/output/posts/comma-free-codes.html">lectures</a>. Stumbled upon this website called
webofstories.com that feature many scientists and carries <em>extensive</em> interviews with them, who reflect upon their
life, their personal moments, their personal views on their achievements.</p>
<p>I watched the entire <a class="reference external" href="http://www.webofstories.com/play/donald.knuth/1">3 hour interview with Donald Knuth</a> and immensely enjoyed it.</p>
<p>One of the excellent moment was, when he shares his 2nd computer program, which was a learning tic-tac-toe. This was
written for the IBM 650 Machine having just 10K bytes of memory.</p>
<img alt="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/650-2.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/650-2.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 300px;"><p>Those days, the programs were written in punched-cards and a typical program would look something like this (location,
instruction).</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0001 0000010000
0002 0000000000-
0003 1000018003

0006 0100008000
0007 6900060005
0008 2019990003
</pre>
<p>Imagine writing an AI program in that. The difficulty of writing does not matter, just the possibility that it could be
written and could be very was exciting, probably led Knuth to write it. This video shows his excitement when he shares
that moment.</p>
<div class="youtube-video align-center">

</div>
<p>Other interview bits are interesting too. Knuth covers academia, maths, computer science, computer history, programming
as art, typography, religion, his dates, his wife, his children and awards he has won. Many interesting things can be
picked up.</p>

<p>With the trend in functional programming up, I noticed a new programming language called "coconut" that implements
functional programing "style". This is written on top of "python", the coconut language scripts are compiled and
translated to python.</p>
<p>For e.g, this factorial coconut program, will be translated to a valid python program.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
def factorial(n):
    """Compute n! where n is an integer &gt;= 0."""
    case n:
        match 0:
            return 1
        match _ is int if n &gt; 0:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    else:
        raise TypeError("the argument to factorial must be an integer &gt;= 0")
</pre>
<p>You can notice the pattern matching style in the above program, which is not a syntax in Python. This program will then
be converted into a valid python program.</p>

<p>Found this introductory post on <a class="reference external" href="https://thesocietea.org/2016/12/core-functional-programming-concepts/">core functional programming concepts</a> dealing with the subject succinctly.
It is easy to approach functional programming, if we can recognize the following concepts held true by all the
functional programs, and languages facilitating them.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">Functions are Pure</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No side-effects, like printing something from the function.</li>
<li>When called with the same input, will always return the same output. We take that for granted, isn't it?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Functions are first-class and are of higher order.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Treat function names as variables.</li>
<li>Toss function (names) as an argument to a function, and as a return value from a function.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Variables are immutable.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Forget mutating variables in a program. If you want an updated value, create a new variable. When you are
getting started with programming, you feel this is questionable. With experience under your belt, you start
to prefer immutability of variables.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Functions have referential transparency.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It follows from functions are pure requirement. The referential transparency requirement is about substituting
the function call with return value, wherever the function is called, should not change the state of the program.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Lambda Calculus</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The mathematics behind functional programming. Take arguments and have a return valued. When evaluating multiple
arguments, the function is evaluated one argument at a time, with result send to next one-arg-less function,
kind of a tail-recursion. This concept is called currying.</li>
</ul>

<p>I stumbled upon a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kbvkj/eli5_why_is_suspension_from_school_a_punishment/">Explain Like I am Five Story which dealt with the rationale behind punishments</a>.  The topic of
punishments is a complex one and needs balanced thinking. The author elucidated many reasons for which punishments are
administered in society. We see the trends of those in both online and offline societies.</p>
<p>Punishments are administered for one of the following reasons.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Incapacitation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is stopping somebody from doing an unacceptable behavior in the society again.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Restitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is getting something back for the victim of somebody who misbehaves, to compensate them for that which they've been
deprived by the offender. Like charging fine and using it for taxes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Retribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is like feeling of justice that deprived might get. Many of us think, this is the primary purpose for punishment. This
is non measurable, but often paves way to other measurable impacts like incapacitation, restitution etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Rehabilitation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose is to give the offender, time to reflect on the wrong doing, possibly empathize with the one affected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Deterrence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is about reducing the likelihood that misbehaviour will occur in the first place. The punishment is more for a warning
to prevent a socially unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Many a social regulatory policies can be mapped to above concepts of negative reinforcements to prevent any undesirable
outcomes.</p>

<p>This post is a short discussion on the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a> 's paper "<a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/teaching-concurrency.pdf">Teaching Concurrency</a>".</p>
<p>Lamport's basic premise is that understanding the system the most important part, and engineers often muddy their
understanding with implementation details as soon as they start talking about programming languages suitable for
concurrency.</p>
<p>He even challenges engineers to come up with the solution for concurrency problems without using "<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphores</a>",
"<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)">monitors</a>", or any other construct that were invented and provided as a tool. Using those, he says, is like using the
'sort' to routine the language to implement a sorting algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
The modern field of concurrency started with Dijkstra’s 1965 paper on the mutual exclusion problem. For most of the
1970s, one “solved” the mutual exclusion problem by using semaphores or monitors or conditional critical regions or
some other language construct. This is like solving the sorting problem by using a programming language with a sort
command. Most of your colleagues can explain how to implement mutual exclusion using a semaphore. How many of them
can answer the following question: Can one implement mutual exclusion without using lower-level constructs that,
like semaphores, assume mutually exclusive access to a resource?</blockquote>
<p>Lamport's approach to problem solving suggests, we need to think of computing problem as series of states instead of
series of steps. I think, series of steps tend to give some linearity the approach, while series of states tend to
indicate that sub-parts of the system can have multiple states and the next state each sub-part can take only depends
upon the current state and action that leads the state transition to the next state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more useful to think about states than sequences of steps because what a computing device does next depends on
its current state, not on what steps it took in the past.</p>
<p>To describe a computation we need to describe a sequence of states. More often, we need to describe the set of
computations that can be produced by some particular computing device, such as an algorithm. There is one method that
works in practice: describing a set of computations by</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the set of all initial initial states and</li>
<li>A next-state relation that describes, for every state, the possible next states that is, the set of states
reachable from that state by a single step.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>On computational thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How should we describe computations?</p>
<p>Most computer scientists would probably interpret this question to mean, what language should we use? Imagine an
art historian answering “how would you describe impressionist painting?” by saying “in French”.</p>
<p>Programming and hardware-design languages don’t help an engineer understand what problem a system should solve.
Thinking of computations as sequences of states, rather than as something described by a language, is the first
step towards such understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lamport also describes in great details about importance of problem specification. Sometimes, when the problem is
specified clearly and understood problem, the solution becomes easy.  Most of our struggles seems to be with coming to
grasp the problem specification.</p>
<blockquote>
The great contribution of Dijkstra’s paper on mutual exclusion was not his solution; it was stating the problem.
(It is remarkable that, in this first paper on the subject, Dijkstra stated all the requirements that distinguish
mutual exclusion from fundamentally simpler and less interesting problems.)</blockquote>
<p><em>On concurrency, itself</em></p>
<p>He gives an example of concurrency problem  that according to him is "trivial". It took me some reading to understand
the problem. <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24989756/what-is-the-inductive-invariant-of-the-simple-concurrent-program">StackOverflow.com</a> certainly helped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once an engineer understands what a computation is and how it is described, she can understand the most important
concept in concurrency: invariance. A computing device does the correct thing only because it maintains a correct
state. Correctness of the state is expressed by an invariant—a predicate that is true in every state of every
computation.</p>
<p>Invariance is the key to understanding concurrent systems, but few engineers or computer scientists have learned to
think in terms of invariants. Here is a simple example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Now, the problem</strong></p>
<p>Consider N processes numbered from 0 through N − 1 in which each process i executes</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x[i] :=1;
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}

y[i] := x[(i-1)modN]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and stops, where each <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> initially equals 0. (The reads and writes of each <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> are assumed to be
atomic.)</p>
<p>This algorithm satisfies the following property: after every process has stopped, <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> equals 1 for at least
one process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> .</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the algorithm satisfies this property; the last process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to write <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> must set
it to 1. But that process doesnt set <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> to 1 because it was the last process to write y.</p>
<p>What a process does depends only on the current state, not on what processes wrote before it. The algorithm satisfies
this property because it maintains an inductive invariant.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The explanation on how <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> equals for 1 at least one process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> goes like this.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <span class="math">\(x_s\)</span> model the following behavior: <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> is 1 if and only if the process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> has already run.</li>
<li>After all processes have completed, all <span class="math">\(x_s\)</span> are thus set to 1.</li>
<li>The <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> are a bit trickier: <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is set if <span class="math">\(x[i-1]\)</span> was set, that is, <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is 1 if and
only if the predecessor of <span class="math">\(i\)</span> had already run when <span class="math">\(i\)</span> was doing its write to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I essentially to had resort to <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24989756/what-is-the-inductive-invariant-of-the-simple-concurrent-program">StackOverflow.com</a> post author's explanation to completely understand this.</p>
<p>The program invariant is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a process has set <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span>, it must already have set <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> to 1.
This is true regardless whether <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is set to 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Proving this invariant is quite easy: In the beginning, none of the <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> is set, so it holds trivially.
During program execution, each write to <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point">sequenced after</a> a write to <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span>. Therefore
the invariant also holds for every step of the program afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The further reasoning goes like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last process to finish sets <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> to 1 because, by definition of being the last process, its
predecessor must have already finished execution at that point (ie. its y value is already set).</p>
<p>Which means, because of the invariant, its <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value (which determines the last process' <span class="math">\(y\)</span> value)
has to be 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alternate way to look at this problem can give some intuitive understanding too.</p>
<blockquote>
You cannot find an execution order in which all <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> are set to 0. Doing so would require all processes to
execute before their predecessor. However, since our processes are arranged in a ring (that is, if I follow the
predecessor chain I will eventually end up at my starting point again), this leads to the contradiction that at
least one process must have finished executing before it wrote to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</blockquote>
<p>To understand this concurrency problem, it requires some notion of syntax, a prior understanding of proving hypothesis,
and possibly discussing the problem and solution.</p>
<p>Trying to understand itself, I guess, is a progress.</p>

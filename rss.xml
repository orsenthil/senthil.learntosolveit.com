by Jennifer Doudna and Samuel Steinberg is a book on gene-editing and a
technology called CRISPR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is a personal narration of Jennifer Doudna as she explains the
development of CRISPR and it's discovery for use in gene editing.  Rather than a
review, this are notes while reading this book.  CRISPR is molecular structure
found in Bacteria, but now more popular term, commonly associated with a gene
editing technique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Given the technical nature of this article, I must have used the text from the
sources only with slight modification for explanation. References should give
the materials I consulted to write this post. In you notice technical
inaccuracy, I aplogize, please point out, and I will correct it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Terms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I reader, I found reviewing biological terms helped me understand the
material better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;DNA, the language of life. Figure from &lt;em&gt;A Crack in Creation&lt;/em&gt; book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Human Body is made of &lt;strong&gt;cells&lt;/strong&gt;, in-fact trillions of cells. Each of these cells
contain something called DNA. &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt; is like recipe, just like a food recipe,
but for building and maintaining living organisms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cells use DNA to make proteins. Proteins are the workhorses of the body, they do
all the stuff we need to do to survive, from digesting food to making other
proteins.  Proteins are molecules made up of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DNA is made up of a long combination of some very basic organic components
called Adenine, Thymine, Guanine and Cytosine. Human DNA consists of about 3
billion of these. The sequence of these determines the information available for
building and maintaining an organism, similar to the way in which letters of the
alphabet appear in a certain order to form words and sentences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the nucleus of each cell, the DNA molecule is packaged into thread-like
structure called &lt;strong&gt;chromosomes&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;em&gt;Chromosome&lt;/em&gt; is a DNA containing structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;RNA are like cousins of DNA, which has an oxygen atom with it. One type called
messager RNA, mRNA, act as carrier of information to different cells, carrying
information from DNA to those cells to produce proteins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far, in above definitions, we didn't emphasize on &lt;em&gt;heredity&lt;/em&gt; , that is,
sending information from parent to child yet. As soon as we start talking about
&lt;em&gt;heredity&lt;/em&gt;, we use the term, &lt;strong&gt;Genes&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A gene is the basic physical and functional unit of heredity. Each chromosome of
human body has many genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we take a single cell from human body, and find out the entire set of
&lt;em&gt;genetic information&lt;/em&gt; in the chromosomes of that cell, we call that a
&lt;strong&gt;Genome&lt;/strong&gt;. A Genome, from &lt;strong&gt;Gen&lt;/strong&gt; e and Chromos &lt;strong&gt;ome&lt;/strong&gt;, is the entire set of
&lt;em&gt;genetic&lt;/em&gt; instructions found inside a cell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR in bacteria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single celled organisms like Bacteria were using a technique to fight off some
diseases.  The term CRISPR was given to an identified characteristic in
Bacterial DNA sequence, which was used to produce a protein called CAS-9, which
in turn, helped to kill the enemy virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and
is a family of DNA Sequences found in genomes of bacteria. CAS9 stands for
CRISPR associated protein 9.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bacteria were found to capture snippets of DNA from invading viruses and use
them to create DNA segments known as CRISPR arrays. The CRISPR arrays allow the
bacteria to "remember" the viruses. If the viruses attack again, the bacteria
produce RNA segments from the CRISPR arrays to target the viruses' DNA. The
bacteria then use Cas9 to cut the DNA apart and kill the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/staumxmyll7ypty/Screenshot_2020-11-27-19-41.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;CRISPR in Bacteria. Figure from &lt;em&gt;Crack in the Creation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR Shaping Human Genome&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The CRISPR-Cas9 system works similarly in the lab. Researchers create a small
piece of RNA with a short "guide" sequence that attaches (binds) to a specific
target sequence of DNA in a genome. The RNA also binds to the Cas9 enzyme. As in
bacteria, the modified RNA is used to recognize the DNA sequence, and the Cas9
enzyme cuts the DNA at the targeted location. Although Cas9 is the enzyme that
is used most often, other enzymes (for example Cpf1) can also be used. Once the
DNA is cut, researchers use the cell's own DNA repair machinery to add or delete
pieces of genetic material, or to make changes to the DNA by replacing an
existing segment with a customized DNA sequence&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When CRISPR was determind that it could be used in lab on living organisms, the
potential for shaping the genome unfolded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First time ever, in over 100,000 years, we have ability to shape the &lt;em&gt;Homo
Sapien&lt;/em&gt; evolution by mechanisms other than random mutation and natural
selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In humans, CRISPR can be used to do a precise repair and produce a normal
protein from a non-functional gene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/zhew8671tk9dnx6/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-04.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR enables scientists to edit and &lt;em&gt;fix&lt;/em&gt; single incorrect letters of DNA from
3.2 billion letters that comprise the human genome. It can also be used to
perform even more complicated edits to Human DNA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A relatively straightforward DNA editing has transformed every genetic disease,
at-least the diseases for which we know the underlying mutation(s) into a
potentially treatable disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR on Animals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR has been used to create gene edited mouse wherein the genome of the
embroyo was edited and introduced back into womb to have an offspring with
the desirable characteristics embedded at time of birth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/l0gxu7imj7v3pqa/Screenshot_2020-11-28-03-51.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Gene Edited Mouse. Figure from &lt;em&gt;A Crack in Creation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we have used gene editing to create animals desirable characteristics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7hdtn904xxas57q/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-01.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Gene edited animals. Figure from &lt;em&gt;A crack in creation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is currently used in practice. Like Recombinetics uses gene editing for
dehorning cattle, a safer method than physical dehorning using hot iron-rods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://recombinetics.com/our-technology/"&gt;&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/r5op4mkkhju3s8p/Screenshot_2020-11-28-07-34.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/r5op4mkkhju3s8p/Screenshot_2020-11-28-07-34.png" style="width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pigs as Bio Reactors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An important field of bio technology is regenerative medicine, desired by human
society who are fighting of some disease eithe naturally or have lost some
ability due an accident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many scientists see the pig itself as a source of medicine. It is seen
that we might be using pigs as bioreactors to produce valuable drugs like
therapeutic human proteins, which are too complex to synthesize from scratch and
can only be produced in living cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/lw2lleanrept8qf/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-07.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have already been looking to
other transgenic animals to produce these biopharmaceutical drugs, or
farmaceuticals, as they’re colloquially called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.revivicor.com/index.html"&gt;Revivicor&lt;/a&gt; is a company that is using CRISPR to produce regenerative medicine,
following the process exactly outlined above. A workflow from their website
gives the details on how Pigs are used as Bio Reactors for regenerative
medicine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a class="reference external image-reference" href="https://www.revivicor.com"&gt;&lt;img alt="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg" src="https://www.revivicor.com/images/RevivicorTechPoster-04-2010.jpg" style="width: 720px;"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Malaria Resistant Mosquitos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The deadliest animal on earth, Mosquito can also be killed using CRISPR. The
idea seems to create malaria resistant mosquitoes using gene editing so that
the entire family is disabled from being a carriers of malaria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qwejig01w6zcyox/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-23.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/qwejig01w6zcyox/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-23.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CRISPR for Therapeutics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CRISPR can be utilized to edit the germ cells outside the body.
The edited germ cells can be planted inside for beneficiary aspects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Ex-vivo CRISPR therapy. A Crack In The Creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For targeted drug delivery, like fixing the lung or particular muscle instead
of injecting the drug into blood stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="figure"&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7zaa0afr6gdipha/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-31.png" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/7zaa0afr6gdipha/Screenshot_2020-11-28-04-31.png" style="width: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p class="caption"&gt;In-vivo CRISPR therapy. A Crack In the Creation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adult Homo sapiens are among the last animals to be treated with CRISPR, human
cell: have been subjected to more CRISPR gene editing than those of any other
organism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have applied CRISPR in lung cells to correct the genetic mutation
that causes cystic fibrosis, in blood cells to correct the mutations that cause
sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia, and in muscle cells to correct the
mutations that cause Duchenne muscular dystrophy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scientists have used CRISPR to edit and repair mutations in stem cells, which
can then be coaxed to transform into virtually any cell or tissue type in the
body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as CRISPR continues to be useful, it's power as a technology and it's
potential misuse is a concern for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Whether we'll ever have the intellectual and moral capacity to
guide our own genetic destiny is an open question - one that has been in my
mind since I began to realize what CRISPR is capable of.
- Jennifer Doudna&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And Jennifer Doudna shares her stance as she says, that the nature will still be
our supreme master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Any mutations that CRISPR might make—intentional or not—would almost certainly
pale in comparison to the genetic storm that rages inside each of us from
birth to death. As one writer put it, “Genetic editing would be a droplet in
the maelstrom of naturally churning genomes.” If CRISPR could eliminate a
disease-causing mutation in the embryo with high certainty and only a slight
risk of introducing a second off-target mutation elsewhere, the potential
payoffs might well outweigh the dangers.

Few years ago, I discovered that the quote is from a book
by Albert Einstein with Title “Essays in Humanism”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mahatma Gandhi&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A LEADER OF his people, unsupported by any outward authority: a politician whose success rests not upon craft nor the mastery of technical devices, but simply on the convincing power of his personality; a victorious fighter who has always scorned the use of force; a man of wisdom and humility, armed with resolve and inflexible consistency, who has devoted all his strength to the up lifting of his people and the betterment of their lot; a man who has confronted the brutality of Europe with the dignity of the simple human being, and thus at all times risen superior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Generations to come, it may be, will scarce believe that such a one as this ever in flesh and blood walked upon this earth.&lt;/p&gt;

This medium article - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://elemental.medium.com/the-most-likely-way-youll-get-infected-with-covid-19-30430384e5a5"&gt;The Most Likely Way You’ll Get Infected With Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; covered it very well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we know&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Surfaces don’t seem to matter as much as originally thought.&lt;ol class="loweralpha"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SARS-CoV-2 does not spread through surfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No need to disinfect food, parcels, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Close range droplets are the new leading theory and Aerosol transmission has gradually gained acceptance&lt;ol class="loweralpha"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Coronavirus Spreads from infected person exhaling and non-infected inhaling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A tiny droplets of virus spread in air in trajectory less than 6 feet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Best way to prevent this - "Wear Mask".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months in, "Wearing Masks" is the &lt;em&gt;most effective&lt;/em&gt; way to protect ourselves. Both to avoid the spread and also to
protect ourselves from getting infected. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incidentally, the first strong support for wearing mask as reducing infections came via statistical analysis by
Jeremy Howard  in the article from May 15 - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://theconversation.com/masks-help-stop-the-spread-of-coronavirus-the-science-is-simple-and-im-one-of-100-experts-urging-governors-to-require-public-mask-wearing-138507"&gt;Masks help stop the spread of coronavirus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3222836989"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I found this book totally captivating. I have followed Indian history
through books, and have been witnessed incidents taking shape, like Babri
Masjid Demolition, Killing of Rajiv Gandhi, Curfew, Coalition Government,
Gujarat Violence and burning of the train, the rise of Cyberabad, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The details provided in this book still captured my attention. The
authors do a wonderful job of providing a "concise history of modern
India", and trying to present the facts as they are.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If we come
across any review that either accuses the book of having some prejudice by
labeling it with terms like "British authors", "leftist" or "does not
capture greatness" or "congress" etc, we can safely assume that the
review-writer was standing in front of the mirror rather than in front of
text and words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Reading history, I often realize that reality
can be stranger than Fiction. This book share ample anecdotes along those
fronts. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The first thing I realized was - British East India
Company had a much difficult time establishing trade relations in the
subcontinent than French or Portuguese who had arrived earlier because
India under Mughal had some resistance going on. They established pure
trade relations, incurring a loss, buying cows from India, and facing
criticism from Britain. The company did not want to give up on the business
opportunity with India and incurred losses for decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then we
notice how Britain captured the whole of India. Robert Clive and Mir Jafir,
a name that has become eponymous with a traitor start the conquer from
South to Nawabs of Bengal. The loot and wealth of India were too tempting
for the British to give up or lose control to locals.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to
know through this book that for administering India, British setup "Indian
Civil Services", the highest administrative body in India, which trains
qualified candidates in both Britain and India through rigorous exams. The
motivation was for that administrative body to report directly to the
British state. The "Indian Civil Services" served the system very well,
continued after Independence, and reporting structure replaced to the
democratically elected official instead of the British state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is a whirlwind, each capture captures multiple events in a
century or decades.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to know that Mohammed Ali Jinnah, had
requested Pakistan to be consisting of multiple divergent states in India
which had Muslim Majority (like Hyderabad, Kashmir, parts of Punjab,
Bengal, etc). He very well knew that having a separate country with
interspersed states was never going to be practical, he wanted to use that
demand as negotiation tactic. However, Nehru and congress never gave into
it. They receded two states of Pakistan on religious identity. Nehru
declared during Independence that India was not built on religious identity
and is not a religious state, thus keeping the plan for India with all the
states in order.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It seems like India had decided that after
independence they will have some money for nation-building purposes. Since
India got partition, I came to know that, it was Gandhi who, in his just
tendencies, requested for 40 million pounds to be given to Pakistan as it's
share. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had known about the factors leading to Independence a
little, but I didn't realize that the British were spending roughly 1000
million pounds per year on India after the war (like supporting Indian
soldiers, infrastructure), which had proven economically very costly to
hold on.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book also deals with more recent events, and
particularly things that struck me was&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a. Keezhaldi massacre and
how no one was ever brought to justice. &lt;br&gt;b. No one was brought to
justice for the Gujarath train massacre. The chief minister, Modi was let
go by the then government in power, BJP under Atal Bihari Vajpayee.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is often that case that being in political majority determined
the outcome of the punishable act, and humanitarian qualities like justice
didn't have a say against power. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As an aside, I could relate to
the above statement even in the 2020 Delhi Riots. BJP government did not
bring anyone to justice. The same argument holds worldwide too wherein, in
the USA, cronyism is so prevalent in republican led administration, and
bringing someone to justice for the wrongdoing seems also non-applicable if
the person has power.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/05/17/book-review-a-concise-history-of-modern-india.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 18 May 2020 04:21:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>GatesNotes - 7 Billion Doses of Vaccine</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/05/01/gatesnotes-7-billion-doses-of-vaccine.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates has an article on &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/What-you-need-to-know-about-the-COVID-19-vaccine"&gt;What you need to know about the COVID-19 vaccine&lt;/a&gt;
The entire article is impressive in terms of the approach to solve this problem. The particular highlight for me was
Bill Gate's emphasis on making sure &lt;strong&gt;everyone in this world&lt;/strong&gt;, yes 7 billion people in this world get the vaccine as
soon as it is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an impressive thinking for a individual. Considering the solution for the entire humanrace, because no human
is different and is equally susceptible to this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-billion-doses"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;7 billion doses&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;We need to manufacture and distribute at least 7 billion doses of the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3155122369"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This was a lengthy book. The interviewers did a fantastic job with their questions and covered a range of expert programmers and language designers across the spectrum. The important thing I gained from reading this book was my "enthusiasm" again for different programming languages and styles. &lt;br&gt;Each different language creator had some "opinions" about the state of affairs and went about in a personal way to do something about it, create a language, create a community, solve the problem, and usually building on top of what the person had learned from others. The language creation is both a scientific process (standing upon the shoulders of giants), as well as the unique taste that each language designer brought to the table. I was excited to learn more about AWK, Haskell, Perl, and Eiffel as languages after reading this book.

&lt;p&gt;Salesforce CEO, Marc Benioff took a 8 step pledge, and with few pledges being, &lt;em&gt;No significant layoff for next 90
days&lt;/em&gt; and encouraging employees to keep their own hourly workers like gardeners, home cleaners employed with pay.
I really appreciate the social responsiblity shown by Marc.&lt;/p&gt;

Manga Guide to Linear Algebra is a manga comic that teaches linear algebra concept. When I stumbled upon the terms Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, I found those were greek to me, and I had no intuitive understanding of those terms. I decided to spend 4-hours to read about the basics of linear algebra from this book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book starts with the concept of sets, functions, and relations. Then introduces matrices, and then vectors. It gives a gentle introduction to various matrix operations. Gives visual clue on vector representations. Introduces the concept of linear dependence and linear independence in vectors.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Shows the examples of linear transformations which are practical applications of linear algebra and finally goes to introduce eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Finally, for Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, these are the examples that are shown.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a example of 2x2 matrix for illustrating Eigenvectors given in the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
c_1[3, 1] + c_2[1, 2] [[8 -3]     -&amp;gt; c1[21, 7] + c_2[2, 4]
                       [2  1]]

c_1[3, 1] + c_2[1, 2] -&amp;gt; f[[8 -3]    -&amp;gt; c_1[7 [3, 1]] + c_2[2 [1, 2]]
                           [2  1]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The image of the expression using the linear transformation, expressed using the same original vectors, but with
coefficients, 7 and 2 now. Then gives the example of 3 dimentional vector, and finally explains the the concept of
Eigenvalue and Eigenvectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the above example, 7 and 2 are eigenvalues, and (3, 1) and (1, 2) are the eigenvectors associated with those eigen
values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word &lt;cite&gt;eigen&lt;/cite&gt; seems to have come from german which means proper or characteristic.  It seems that we express the
original expression with the linear transformation properly using some values and vectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>books</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/04/07/book-review-manga-guide-to-linear-algebra.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Apr 2018 19:24:19 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Coursera - Image and Video Processing: From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/03/17/finished-coursera-course-image-and-video-processing-from-mars-to-hollywood-with-a-stop-at-the-hospital.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/image-processing/home/welcome"&gt;Image and Video Processing - From Mars to Hollywood with a Stop at the Hospital&lt;/a&gt; is the course offered
by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guillermo_Sapiro"&gt;Guillermo Sapiro&lt;/a&gt; at Coursera. After a long time, I voluntarily took a course and finished it. I didn't pay for
the course and so, I won't get a certificate. But I have this, and the course completion recorded in my
accomplishments in coursera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was wonderful course, I learnt about digital signal processing, and image transformations.&lt;/p&gt;

The Origins of Money&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Szabo"&gt;Nick Szabo&lt;/a&gt;
It starts with the origin of money in the european colony of the americas, how and
why a mass scale currency was introduced by colonists upon the native americans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Based on this anecdote, it discusses some of the important properties of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It defines the role of money to a basic human need for co-operation. Money, it says is delayed exchange of altruism
on part by humans. And money sould have properties like non-stealable, non-reproducible in order to be valuable. The
human society devised multiple tools for this kind. When the problem was met with scale, they invented a "fiat
currency", started in China, was way to scale currency, and keep a ledger for supply and demand.
The coin system that was first invented in &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.ancient.eu/lydia/"&gt;Lydia&lt;/a&gt; is the same coin system that we use today, and the fiat currency
is still in use. Except now that we have the technology to scale currency without trusting or depending on a
government to maintain a ledger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>economics</category><category>paper</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/03/06/shelling-out-origins-of-money.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 06 Mar 2018 17:33:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Odds</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/03/04/odds.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recollected this favorite poem of my mine from school days.

His name is not familiar to many. I understood, he is known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the
second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learnt some valuable computer science concepts too
since this was taught to a child, it was very easy to grasp. The concepts share are
foundational and it is presented in a neat, easy to understand manner. I internalized the
importance of "naming", the thing with jargons and principle of 5-whys. Very helpful book.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2018</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/07/book-review-lauren-ipsum-a-story-about-computer-science-and-other-improbable-things.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 03:00:43 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

This is a personal memoir of the author, Thi Bui, as she tries to recollect her own story of coming to the US as
a refugee from Vietnam on a boat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fast forward many years, the author is well educated, accomplished
in life, settled in society, and has a family of her own. When she has her first child, she tries to associate
herself with her mother and her times in Vietnam and their family migration to the US. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It covers the
political history of Vietnam well, and how the ordinary people suffered, without any exception, both at the hands
 of external oppressors and from local oppressors alike. There was no way out, except to Run away. And, run they
 did, in search for stabler societies so they and their children at-least can have a chance to live.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a heart-wrenching story as she understands the story of her own mother, father, and the reason they become the way they are, the hardships and life that they have seen in other parts of the world, the risks they took, and ultimately, the best they could do for their children.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is a family story, and it helps us understand our own parents better.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quotes that I liked from the book&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“This - not any particular piece of Vietnamese culture - is my inheritance: the inexplicable need and
extraordinary ability to run when the shit hits the fan. My refugee reflex.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To understand how my father became the way he was, I had to learn what happened to him as a little boy. It took a long time to learn the right questions to ask.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― Thi Bui, The Best We Could Do&lt;/p&gt;

This is a highly influential book in the subject of how Computers work from ground up. They author deals with the subject and introduces computers as if they were a natural evolution of inventions that had already taken effect and had proved useful to the society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;After introducing the various needs for communication, the author explains how it can achieved using bulbs, and then chips, and then how it is stored and done at the higher scale using Computers. He goes both in the Hardware as well as Software section of how computers work, and why we need operating systems and programming languages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The section on float point arithmetic caught my attention and imagination completely. This was a lucid explanation on storing decimal valued numbers using binary digits.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I throughly enjoyed this, and is already helping me appreciate some of the basic concepts used in Computers and Computer Science.

This is the first health book that I could not put down. This is the book that is helping me to manage my weight and my health. So, it is a life-saving book for me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was worried about my weight gain, and my lack of time to do exercises. I have 2 kids now and have an hour commute to my work. Both of these leave me with very less time to do exercises regularly, and I was constantly feeling worried about weight gain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book helped to break the problem into two.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;a) Managing Weight.&lt;br&gt;b) Doing Exercises.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For a), I completely understood how this can be controlled by paying attention to the Calorie intake. That' it. I adjusted my calories and I went back to -3KG within 3 weeks. I have goal to go -13 kgs further so that I can maintain my weight at a desirable number. I am into managing of my weight now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once that is done, I know the need and utility value for exercises and I will able to make time for it to live for longer so that I could continue doing whatever I like.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Rarely, self-help books have proved valuable to me. This the 2nd self-help book that I can say that, it has proved valuable to me and the concepts taught will remain with me for the rest of my life.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thank you, John Walker.&lt;br&gt;

published at this site called twobithistory&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Author goes in into the details on History of Lisp, the motivation behind the
design, how the language, and an early book "SICP" created a culture of
veneration for that language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He also credits Paul Graham, and XKCD comics to have significantly surged the
interest back in lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interesting anecdotes like how braces end up being chosen for the language. The
motivation of the SICP book was very noble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/10/16/lisp-two-bit-history-article.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 17 Oct 2018 00:28:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>My writing projects</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/08/22/my-writing-projects.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I have three projects that are focused on technical writing, note taking and documentation of computer science concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.learntosolveit.com/"&gt;http://www.learntosolveit.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.coursedocs.org/"&gt;http://www.coursedocs.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;And my blog &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xtoinfinity.com/"&gt;http://xtoinfinity.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like these projects could be consolidated, merged into a single domain. I am thinking of merging&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.learntosolveit.com/"&gt;http://www.learntosolveit.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and calling it learntosolveit.com&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I am thinking of hosting &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://xtoinfinity.com/"&gt;http://xtoinfinity.com/&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;cite&gt;senthil.learntosolveit.com&lt;/cite&gt; setup the appropriate domain
redirections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since these are writing projects, keeping them consolidated seem to make sense to me. Still wondering what the
dis-advantages of this will be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>projects</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/08/22/my-writing-projects.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Aug 2018 07:39:26 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Hash Table in C</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/08/21/hash-table-in-c.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;p&gt;I tried this simple project to write a hash table in C - &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orsenthil/ht"&gt;https://github.com/orsenthil/ht&lt;/a&gt; using this tutorial

Agatha Christie won the bet my with my reading of the book too. I could not figure out the murderer or figure out the plot. It may be hard or impossible for the reader to find the plot as the information that is shared with is limited and more information is revealed as the plot is disclosed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was an enjoyable book with the variety of characters and it took me a to mid-century England for the hours I was reading this book.&lt;/span&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/08/13/book-review-the-mysterious-affair-at-styles.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 13 Aug 2018 14:47:17 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Astrophysics for People in a Hurry</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/08/04/book-review-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191710-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Astrophysics for People in a Hurry" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1527255595m/32191710.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191710-astrophysics-for-people-in-a-hurry"&gt;Astrophysics for People in a Hurry&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12855.Neil_deGrasse_Tyson"&gt;Neil deGrasse Tyson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I loved this book. This is a very short book, to the point, and explains the universe in simple terms. What I didn't expect and was a surprise to me was the Author's humorous anecdotes, completely relevant to the present day reader inserted between the concepts in the pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For e.g. It was funny to know that behind US Govt which consumes Helium for military and research, the next second highest consumer of "Helium" was Macy's for it's Macy's day parade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was startling to know that life as we understand in any form, the single-celled organism has started in existence only the last 2% of the history of the universe. The universe is very very old, very very big. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often there is a question on "Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" - The more I read these kinds of books, the more I realize that "There is life elsewhere in the universe. Highly likely. It is inevitable that either Earthians discover the other life forms, and they discover the Earthians. Also, the timeline of advancement, the calamities that are possible in next thousand years, humankind will, of course, take the ship, explore, and start settling in various other parts of the universe. Thinking like this doesn't sound like fiction to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a great book. I will start looking out for Neil DeGrasse Tyson from now.&lt;p&gt;Here are some excerpts that I noted from the book. This one is about Einstein, and the kind of impact he had in our
understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ua8m0eenypplx1j/astrophysics1.jpg?dl=0" class="align-center" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/ua8m0eenypplx1j/astrophysics1.jpg?dl=0" style="width: 550px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this one is about Spherical shape for any object that we may encounter in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

For human decisions, being right is
debatable too. Being less wrong appears desirable and achievable. If a person is committed to non-perfectionist
philosophy, then being less wrong falls right into his stride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I stumbled upon the phrase Less Wrong from the blog lesswrong.com. In the &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TNHQLZK5pHbxdnz4e/references-and-resources-for-lesswrong"&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;
section I discovered some insight into what tries to achieve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
... even smart people can be completely wrong but that most people are not even wrong.
It teaches you to be careful in what you emit and to be skeptical of what you receive.
It doesn't tell you what is right, it teaches you how to think and to become less wrong.
And to do so is in your own self interest ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/07/30/less-wrong.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 30 Jul 2018 16:01:36 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

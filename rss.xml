non-operational. The cluster was able to see itself, but if I login to master
node, I noticed it was not able communicate externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS Resolution for any site from master was failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I figured that Ubuntu had made some changes to resolve.conf protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu requested users not to edit /etc/resolv.conf, and it's content on my
cluster was not something that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had setup pihole, and my devices had started to see the internet through
this. I noticed that Ubuntu since 18.04 had not set my router as the first
nameserver and thus after pi-hole experiment, my master node lost its
resolution capability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the Ubuntu DNS resolution was easy. I followed &lt;cite&gt;this post from datawookie&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolvconf package was already installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got the idea and followed this Youtube video &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LcdpQ2LLK0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LcdpQ2LLK0&lt;/a&gt; for building the house.&lt;/p&gt;

It was much easier than I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/GlSDW8O.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/GlSDW8O.png" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a Raspberry 4 for the master, and an agent. And I used two Raspberry B for two agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/kCB1tq0.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/kCB1tq0.png" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I setup using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mhausenblas.info/kube-rpi/"&gt;mhausenblas tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://k3s.io/"&gt;k3s&lt;/a&gt; for setting up of kubernetes on raspberry pis.
I used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup"&gt;k3sup&lt;/a&gt; tool for installation of packages, which worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall goal ran into some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not able to setup the kubernetes dashboard via helm package, and I had to use instructions from github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not able to setup minecraft using the available helm package: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues/433"&gt;https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues/433&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used k3sup to install packages, but I do not know how to uninstall the package using k3sup &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup/issues/179"&gt;https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup/issues/179&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Givem all these, I still have the my local kubernetes cluster up and running and I am excited about the possiblities
of using kubernetes on raspberry pis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/02/kubernetes-cluster-using-raspberry-pi.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 21:11:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: The Manga Guide to Calculus</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/01/22/book-review-the-manga-guide-to-calculus.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309077-the-manga-guide-to-calculus" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="The Manga Guide to Calculus" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328753481l/6309077._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309077-the-manga-guide-to-calculus"&gt;The Manga Guide to Calculus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2865700.Hiroyuki_Kojima"&gt;Hiroyuki Kojima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I tried to pick up some high-level intuition on the basics of calculus with this book, but I failed. Unlike, other Manga guides on electricity, and linear algebra, I found this book not very strong on the plot and I felt it did not present the story in a cohesive manner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The concepts were introduced randomly, and I could not see how one built upon the previously introduced concept. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the positive note, it did introduce very basics of calculus well, and I am eager to pick up other books on calculus with that foundation.

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003926912"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is a science-fiction adventure book. If you are a science-fiction fan, like me, then you are for a treat in reading in this book. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I really loved this book and the narration. It started as a simple story but quickly jumped to an adventure plot, and before I realized it had excellent science mixed into every element of this fictitious story. It has references to Fourier, Poisson and you find calculations for measuring the distances based on sound lag, it has adventures of an Iceland hiker, a cave explorer, a climber, and then you will you biologists in trilobite, yes, a trilobite! and then you find all the pre-historic animals and reference famous explorers, biologists, taxonomists all present in a single story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I choose the book, and read the plot, I wondered "How is this possible"? But when I read it, I was taken into a real adventure by the author. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I read this book in "Kindle-In-Motion" format, and illustrator, Killian Eng is a class on his own. He did excellent work and justice for this Jule Verne's timeless work.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here are some of my notes and highlights from this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is something about Fourier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Was it not always believed until Fourier that the temperature of the interplanetary spaces decreased perpetually?&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About Poisson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Well, I will tell you that true savants, among them Poisson, have demonstrated that if a heat of 360,000 degrees
existed in the interior of the globe.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trilobite"&gt;trilobite&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
“Very well,” said he quietly, “it is the shell of a crustacean, of an extinct species called a trilobite. Nothing more.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these pre-historic animals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
leptotheria, mericotheria, lophiodia, anoplotheria, megatheria, mastodons, protopitheci, pterodactyls, and all sorts of extinct monsters here assembled together for his special satisfaction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the adventurers!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Mr. Milne-Edwards! Ah! Mr. de Quatrefages, how I wish you were standing here at the side of Otto Liedenbrock!”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book was a thorough adventure, with so many references to explore further!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/01/22/book-review-journey-to-the-center-of-the-earth.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 22 Jan 2020 12:43:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Sita's Ramayana</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/01/22/book-review-sitas-ramayana.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11097473-sita-s-ramayana" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Sita's Ramayana" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1388198774l/11097473._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11097473-sita-s-ramayana"&gt;Sita's Ramayana&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/342139.Samhita_Arni"&gt;Samhita Arni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3151562925"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I really enjoyed reading Samhita Arni's take on Ramayana, Sita's Ramayana, the story of Ramayana entirely narrated by Sita. It gives a new perspective to the entire story, while not-at-all deviating from the plot and details of the story. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As a reader who is familiar with the story, I picked up this book with a notion of what I can expect. However, I was still surprised and thoroughly enjoyed reading this story presented by an excellent writer (Samhita) and a fantastic illustration (Moyna Chitrakar). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Following this book, I became eager to check out other works of this author, and I found that her writings bring a freshness to the Indian mythology genre, and I am highly eager to read her next work "The Prince". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Enjoyed reading Paul Graham's essays. It is quite dated, for e.g, lots of reference to Web in the 1990s, 2000s time when Yahoo was a prominent .com company. Some of his opinions on wealth creation are still applicable in 2020. But we have to read his essays with plenty of skepticism. He sings praise for lisp and instills some desire in the reader to study lisp and start a startup.

This book is one of it's kind. I had never come across a topic like this one. It reads like a monologue but dwells a lot into History and societal norms. It dwells in Native American history because the author is a native American, and explains his life story and story of his friends in a compelling manner. The incidents take place in Oakland, ca, and the reader familiar with the region can relate to many incidents narrated in the story. The story is an eye-opener for many to perceive the native American culture a little broadly and in a practical manner.

His name is not familiar to many. I understood, he is known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the
second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, "If he had lived we would have known something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>maths</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/02/17/radians-and-roger-coats.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 21:23:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Beyond the Door</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/09/book-review-beyond-the-door.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6468230-beyond-the-door" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Beyond the Door" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328315609m/6468230.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6468230-beyond-the-door"&gt;Beyond the Door&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4764.Philip_K_Dick"&gt;Philip K.

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learnt some valuable computer science concepts too
since this was taught to a child, it was very easy to grasp. The concepts share are
foundational and it is presented in a neat, easy to understand manner. I internalized the
importance of "naming", the thing with jargons and principle of 5-whys. Very helpful book.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2018</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/07/book-review-lauren-ipsum-a-story-about-computer-science-and-other-improbable-things.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 03:00:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Paper: Chubby Lock Service</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/05/paper-chubby-lock-service.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://research.google.com/archive/chubby-osdi06.pdf"&gt;The Chubby Lock Service for Loosely-Coupled Distributed Systems&lt;/a&gt; is the internal distributed lock service that

by the author of the famous software &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.haproxy.org/"&gt;HAProxy&lt;/a&gt; introduces
the concept of load-balancing and talks about the need for load-balancing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="section" id="definitions"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scaling&lt;/em&gt; - Since the power of any server is limited, a web application must be able to run on
multiple servers to accept an ever increasing number of users. this is called as scaling. when
application is running on internet, the site's maintainer has to find ways to spread the load
on several servers, either through internal mechanisms, external components or via re-design.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Load Balancing&lt;/em&gt; - Load Balancing is the ability make several
servers participate in the same service and do the same work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;High Availability&lt;/em&gt; - The ability to maintain unaffected service during
any previous number of simultaneous failures is called high availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point is, &lt;em&gt;load balancing&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;high availability&lt;/em&gt; are different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The article focuses the different load-balancing options, gives details on Layer 3/4 load balancer, Layer 7 load
balancer and where those are used.&lt;/p&gt;

For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book might be a quick, due to
glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/26/book-review-the-linux-command-line.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2017 15:29:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Neuromancer</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/888628.Neuromancer" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 15:33:03 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-interest-for-maths"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Interest for Maths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;My personal self-discipline is I start at page one and do all the
odd-numbered exercises because they have the answers. I keep all the stuff
in a notebook. Anything less just doesn't work for me. I've done calculus
and linear algebra and statistics and dynamics, which is engineering, and
analytic geometry, and I'm about to start hitting differential equations
really hard. What happened was my mother-in-law bought me a book at a swap
meet for 50 cents, and it was "The Magic of Mathematics" or something like
that. It was a low-level book and it got me started again. I do math as a
backdrop. I'm kind of compulsive about building things, making things, and
dBASE was one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;` Interview with Wayne Ratliff`_  - He wrote dBase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-i-was-a-computer"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;I was a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Wayne Ratliff: Computers themselves got me away from car design. Before I
completed my degree, I got a job with Martin Marietta in Denver. I was a
computer. My job title was computer. Other people have programmed
computers, but I have been one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-databases-and-natural-language-research"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Databases and Natural Language Research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I went out and bought lots of books on natural language and artificial
intelligence. I kept getting drawn from one place to another, and I did lots
of experiments. I hadn't researched the database as much as I did the
natural-language aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-self-reflection"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;self-reflection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The way I've programmed all my life is as a toolmaker. When I compare
myself, even ten years ago, with other programmers, I see that I was trying
to generalize to a large extent; they were trying to write programs that
would solve a specific need. Their programs would frequently be delivered
much sooner than mine would be, but mine would have longer lifetimes. Once
the specific need went away, their programs were dead, they had to be
rewritten each time the needs changed. I always wrote in such a way that the
program could solve a family of problems, rather than just a single one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-hacker"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;hacker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Wayne Ratliff: Yes. Do you think hacker is a good word or a bad word? If you
think it's a good word, then they're hackers. They're good people, but
they're thinking of their job rather than the user, and you have to go a
little beyond that. That's how dBASE got started. I was thinking of how I
wanted to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p class="last"&gt;Useful writing makes claims that are as strong as they can be made without becoming false.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very long essay. The crux is write true statements useful to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-job-search"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;job search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I could go on bemoaning the many disappointing experiences I had on this
slog of a job search. There were many of them. 23 interviews and I didn’t
get a single offer. I have always sought to be completely honest and humble
with myself and others about my abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience after getting fired from twitter. I attend 20-30 interviews and I managed to clear one.
The experience frustrated me to no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal experience at Square interview was one of humiliation. I was escorted out after the 1st round as I could
not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-cottage-industry"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;cottage industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;There is a cottage industry springing up around passing interviews - All of
this algorithm challenge hubub started with popular companies like Google.
There were several engineers who worked at these popular tech companies that
saw an opportunity to make a few bucks be offering prep material. There were
two influential books written on the subject: Cracking the Coding Interview and
Elements of Programming Interviews. Both of these books offer guided interview
preparation material. The problem is that the industry got a hold of these
books and tailored their interviews to the book’s material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is real. So many start-ups help you prepare for the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Acceptance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Complaining about it wont do any good.  - Sooner or later I’m going to have to
get another job. Even if I don’t like the methodology, I am going to have to go
through the loop again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final conclusions makes it a balanced article, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good way to find the right candidates. These interviews of-course help test if the candidate can code,
has prepared for the interview and is taking the process seriously. I am with this process until we find a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix10/tech/full_papers/Hunt.pdf"&gt;ZooKeeper- Wait-free coordination for Internet-scale systems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Patrick Hunt and Mahadev Konar of Yahoo! Grid and Flavio P. Junqueira and Benjamin Reed of Yahoo! Research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-wait-free"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;wait-free&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Our system,  Zookeeper,hence implements an API that manipulates
simple wait-free data objects organized hierarchically as in file systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-linearizable-writes"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Linearizable writes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;With ZooKeeper, we are able to implement all coordination primitives that our applications require, even though
only writes are linearizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-ordering-gaurantees"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Ordering Gaurantees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper has two basic ordering guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linearizable writes: All requests that update the state of  ZooKeeper  are
serializable  and  respect precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;FIFO client order: All requests from a given client are executed  in the
order  that  they  were  sent  by  the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important design of the Zookeeper was in the Client API used by the clients, server is a well defined architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Zookeeper for the Packer service, which is a service to manage artifacts on Aurora scheduler (on Mesos)  at
twitter. ZK was used along with hadoop for storing package metadata. This was overkill for simple operation, and it
was decided migrate the service from ZK to a relational database like MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had worked on the client of this service in python and also wrote certain parts the migration client in java.&lt;/p&gt;

that could have been prevented by &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt; proposed systems to make Zookeeper Byzantine Fault Tolerant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-intended-use"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;intended use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It is intended for use within a loosely-coupled distributed system consisting
of moderately large numbers of small machines connected by a high-speed
network. For example, a Chubby instance (also known as a Chubby cell) might
serve ten thousand 4-processor machines connected by 1Gbit/s Ethernet. Most
Chubby cells are confined to a single data centre or machine room, though we do
run at least one Chubby cell whose replicas are separated by thousands of
kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-backup"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Every few hours, the master of each Chubby cell writes a snapshot of its
database to a GFS file server in a different building. The use of a
separate building ensures both that the backup will survive building damage,
and that the backups introduce no cyclic dependencies in the system; a GFS cell
in the same building potentially might rely on the Chubby cell for electing its
master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-time-safety"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;time safety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I see choosing "new" languages (or frameworks) as very risky propositions to
the life of a project. These languages are less likely to be around in ten or
twenty years time (newer and better Rusts and Gos are likely to form in the
years ahead) and in the meantime require you to constantly expend effort to
prevent your projects from being turned into a brick by
language/environment/library changes. In contrast my old C projects from 5-8
years ago still compile and run, with one particular example only needing a
small modification. It's not perfect, but C is much more likely to be the
"safe" option if time x usefulness of your project is a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argues that we spend time quickly adopting new languages and frameworks, take it for granted that anything we write
will be short-lived. Author argues that it is wrong philosophy to adopt, and I agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose to experiment, but build something that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="docutils"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-announce/2020-February/000138.html"&gt;OpenSSH 8.2 released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-rsa-compromise"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;rsa compromise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better alternatives include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RFC8332 RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
"ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
client and server support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
OpenSSH since release 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The RFC5656 ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely need a better name for these algorithms. RSA, the term, is so much easier to remember and associate than
SHA-2, ED25519, and ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramsey did all this, and more, in an alarmingly short lifespan. He died at the
age of 26 probably from leptospirosis (bacteria from the feces of animals)
contracted by swimming in the river Cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Rather than focus on a ‘oneness’ or God, like his brother Michael, he thought
the good life was to be found within our human, fallible, ways of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-once-a-mathematician-always-a-mathematician"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;once a mathematician, always a mathematician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its heart, mathematics is about understanding the underlying structure
inherent in a given area of interest —and where no such structure exists —to
deﬁne the minimal structure that is needed to make forward progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phases involved in the creative process were ﬁrst described by German
physiologist Herman Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century. He identiﬁed
three stages of creativity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturation,
incubation and
illumination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;These three stages have since been augmented with the additional step of
veriﬁcation by the scientiﬁc community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-mathematical-techniques-are-algorithms"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;mathematical techniques are algorithms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speciﬁc mathematical techniques e.g., differentiation, integration or the
Simplex method are algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="last arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To truly appreciate an algorithm and understand how it works, one needs to
be able to run it by hand on a representative set of examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mathematics, this translates to being able to differentiate or integrate
a given expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latter requires a set of semi-mechanical steps and this is where one
uses aids such as scratch memory provided by pencil and paper —something for
which I needed to compensate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, a true understanding of the underlying algorithm is far more
important than any speciﬁc technique that one might devise for running the
algorithm on speciﬁc instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could relate to author's experience in solving some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Finding the day of the week. I went by the logic that, 1st January of 1900 was a Monday, and then I figured out
hte day of the week. This problem was given in the book, Let us C, by Yashwant Kanetkar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Playing a nimm like game. I had a designed a similar game called 21-match stick game in the college. It was a very
simple game, wherein the player forced to pick the last match stick looses. This was again from the exercise in the
Yashwant Kanetkar book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recollect, I think, I had a good saturation phase in reading the "Let us C" book by reading, reviewing.
Incubation by trial and errors, and development of the game itself was illumninatiom and when I let my friends play
it, it was the verification stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;cost of ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;You won't live long enough to learn more than a tiny fraction of all there is
to know. Ideas have costs in the time it takes to learn them, the amount of
maintenance required to remember them and the amount of effort it takes to
apply them. Prefer ideas that have a high power-to-cost ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Fixing things that should not be broken&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No time for learning things&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read "Kubernetes from Ground Up" again. Practised and "understood" the concepts better.
With all these, the tests were actually very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/08/ckad.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 09 Feb 2020 05:34:32 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi Cluster - Fixing DNS Resolv on Master</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/08/raspberry-pi-cluster-fixing-dns-resolv-on-master.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had setup a raspberry pi cluster, and suddenly the master became
non-operational. The cluster was able to see itself, but if I login to master
node, I noticed it was not able communicate externally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNS Resolution for any site from master was failing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then I figured that Ubuntu had made some changes to resolve.conf protocol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ubuntu requested users not to edit /etc/resolv.conf, and it's content on my
cluster was not something that I wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had setup pihole, and my devices had started to see the internet through
this. I noticed that Ubuntu since 18.04 had not set my router as the first
nameserver and thus after pi-hole experiment, my master node lost its
resolution capability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fixing the Ubuntu DNS resolution was easy. I followed &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://datawookie.netlify.com/blog/2018/10/dns-on-ubuntu-18.04/"&gt;this post from datawookie&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;resolvconf package was already installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit /etc/resolvconf/resolv.conf.d/head&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
nameserver &amp;lt;pi-hole-server&amp;gt;
nameserver 8.8.4.4
nameserver 8.8.8.8
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol class="arabic simple" start="3"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restart the resolvconf server&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
sudo service resolvconf restart
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/08/raspberry-pi-cluster-fixing-dns-resolv-on-master.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 14:38:27 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Thank you notes for Supporting Science</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/03/thank-you-notes-for-supporting-science.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had supported this project called &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.donorschoose.org/project/modeling-is-key-to-understand-processes/4573244/"&gt;"Modeling Is Key to Understand Processes, Structures and Scales!"&lt;/a&gt; by Mrs.
Sexton of Montevideo Elementary School for the fifth graders. They had this project going on for the family science
night in the winter of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my birthday this year, I received a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/teWivefK8ZZPMJUa7"&gt;ton of thank you notes&lt;/a&gt; for the supporting this project. It felt amazing to
see so many handwritten cards!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to students, and the teacher for this gesture.

&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/a3eJY9n.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/a3eJY9n.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got the idea and followed this Youtube video &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LcdpQ2LLK0"&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LcdpQ2LLK0&lt;/a&gt; for building the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a fun project!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/02/modern-house-in-minecraft.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2020 02:19:21 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Kubernetes Cluster Using Raspberry Pi</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/02/kubernetes-cluster-using-raspberry-pi.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I setup a kubernetes cluster using Raspberry pi. It was much easier than I had imagined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/GlSDW8O.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/GlSDW8O.png" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used a Raspberry 4 for the master, and an agent. And I used two Raspberry B for two agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/kCB1tq0.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/kCB1tq0.png" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I setup using &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://mhausenblas.info/kube-rpi/"&gt;mhausenblas tutorial&lt;/a&gt;, which uses &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://k3s.io/"&gt;k3s&lt;/a&gt; for setting up of kubernetes on raspberry pis.
I used &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup"&gt;k3sup&lt;/a&gt; tool for installation of packages, which worked well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My overall goal ran into some challenges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not able to setup the kubernetes dashboard via helm package, and I had to use instructions from github.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I was not able to setup minecraft using the available helm package: &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues/433"&gt;https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server/issues/433&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I used k3sup to install packages, but I do not know how to uninstall the package using k3sup &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup/issues/179"&gt;https://github.com/alexellis/k3sup/issues/179&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Givem all these, I still have the my local kubernetes cluster up and running and I am excited about the possiblities
of using kubernetes on raspberry pis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/02/kubernetes-cluster-using-raspberry-pi.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 02 Feb 2020 21:11:53 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: The Manga Guide to Calculus</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/01/22/book-review-the-manga-guide-to-calculus.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309077-the-manga-guide-to-calculus" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="The Manga Guide to Calculus" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1328753481l/6309077._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6309077-the-manga-guide-to-calculus"&gt;The Manga Guide to Calculus&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2865700.Hiroyuki_Kojima"&gt;Hiroyuki Kojima&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2535927955"&gt;2 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I tried to pick up some high-level intuition on the basics of calculus with this book, but I failed. Unlike, other Manga guides on electricity, and linear algebra, I found this book not very strong on the plot and I felt it did not present the story in a cohesive manner. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The concepts were introduced randomly, and I could not see how one built upon the previously introduced concept. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On the positive note, it did introduce very basics of calculus well, and I am eager to pick up other books on calculus with that foundation.

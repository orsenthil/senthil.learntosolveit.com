He took the opportunity to explain Covid-19,
growth, trajectory and more importantly pressing question on when this growth will stop using mathematical equations.
I was highly impressed. It helped to make sense of the situation, and help with dealing with the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please watch this video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube-video"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Kas0tIxDvrg?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The video deals with the questions explained in the slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/46Tu2D9.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/46Tu2D9.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exponential growth means as you go from one day to the next, it involves multiplying by a constant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/Rk3p1TP.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/Rk3p1TP.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of an Equation the exponential growth is represented mathematically like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/sTmqAyB.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/sTmqAyB.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Blue1Brown says that this data fits in a linear regression model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linear regression calculates an equation that minimizes the distance between the fitted line and all of the data points.
And if want to find the equation that minimizes the distance between a line and the data point, the most common way
is to find &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/data/least-squares-regression.html"&gt;"least square regression"&lt;/a&gt; .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will notice that the least square regression ends up with an equation of line &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(y = m \dot x + b\)&lt;/span&gt;
Where &lt;cite&gt;m&lt;/cite&gt; is same as the multiplying factor the exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So he uses the data point to track the growth for linear regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/K1FQ7E1.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/K1FQ7E1.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And finds out &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R^2\)&lt;/span&gt; which is a coefficient of determination,  a statistical measure of how close the data are to the fitted regression line.
We notice that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(R2\)&lt;/span&gt; is close to 1.0 which is a straight line, increasing by a factor, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(m\)&lt;/span&gt; each day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is making a point with logistic regression that, when a country has 100 times lower cases than another country,
the country is not 100 times better, but just 30 days behind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/BrhVPIU.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/BrhVPIU.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And following the numbers, if we extrapolate, we hit a 1 billion cases in 81 days. But that's hardly desirable, and
everyone wants to know when we do stop growing linearly and hit a plateau. He notes that "Linear Growth" is a
theoretical phenomenon, not a realistic one. Just like, if you were not married last year, and you got married this
yea, it does not mean, will you marry every year from now. (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.explainxkcd.com/wiki/index.php/605:_Extrapolating"&gt;Explain XKCD&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/q0h9nux.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/q0h9nux.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But unlike marriage, we are seeing an exponential growth here. We will have to find out the factors that reduce the
exponential growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, in reality what we are expecting is a &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function"&gt;logistic curve&lt;/a&gt; where the exponential growth includes damping factor
contributed by people who are not infected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our whole idea, then becomes to &lt;strong&gt;increase this damping factor&lt;/strong&gt;, that is not get infected by this virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/vpRwguZ.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/vpRwguZ.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes the growth factor go down other than maxing out at the total population?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance with the growth factor of 1.15, we have this number&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/mAX2ICl.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/mAX2ICl.png" style="width: 550px; height: 350px;"&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decrease the number of people getting exposed - aka social isolation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decrease the probability of exposure - aka wash your hands completely, maintain hygiene amongst other things.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And important point to remember in this damping factor is, the &lt;strong&gt;output decreases exponentially too&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/FltSCBb.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/FltSCBb.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and reduces significantly, only by &lt;em&gt;10%&lt;/em&gt; decrease in the damping factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://i.imgur.com/aka3Jxt.png" src="https://i.imgur.com/aka3Jxt.png"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3Blue1Brown has tried to quantify our worry factor and leaves us with an advice that, "if we are not worried, that's
only thing to worry about".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have name for unknown, &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronavirus_disease_2019"&gt;Covid-19&lt;/a&gt; and a strategy to deal with this epimedic now, and we can reduce the damping
factor to the control the growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/03/15/covid-19-exponential-growth-lecture-of-3blue1brown.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 21:13:54 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Happy Pi Day</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/03/14/happy-pi-day.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div class="section" id="happy-pi-day"&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/3003927797"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Bits are Bit. Even if they are transmitted through electrons in copper wires or light in fiber optical cables or via modulation in radio waves. All of these carry bits and run the world. This book covers the intersection between technology, society, the justice system, policies, and politics. It is highly approachable and helps you appreciate technology, not just from a technical standpoint but from a societal standpoint. I really appreciate the concern for fellow human beings put forefront in this book. It opens the reader's mind to care a lot about the political process and be aware that any technology we design is going to have a wide societal impact.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;This was an unbelievable interview with &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Vapnik"&gt;Vladimir Vapnik&lt;/a&gt;. He is the co-inventor of Support Vector Machines, one of
widely used statistical machine learning algorithm. In explaining his understanding of the world, he uses the
mathematical terms of predicate and functions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He often went back to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/storytelling/plots/propp/31_narratemes.htm"&gt;Vladimir Propp&lt;/a&gt; to 31 functions that explained russian folk tales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladmir Vapnik is a truly a humble, honest, accurate person, trying to &lt;em&gt;understand&lt;/em&gt; and then solve a well defined
problem of Hand-writing recognition, within his lifetime. I was amazed while listening to him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/28/interview-with-vladimir-vapnik.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 28 Feb 2020 14:03:09 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Reading: Exam Success Predictor</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/02/24/reading-exam-success-predictor.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-interest-for-maths"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Interest for Maths&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;My personal self-discipline is I start at page one and do all the
odd-numbered exercises because they have the answers. I keep all the stuff
in a notebook. Anything less just doesn't work for me. I've done calculus
and linear algebra and statistics and dynamics, which is engineering, and
analytic geometry, and I'm about to start hitting differential equations
really hard. What happened was my mother-in-law bought me a book at a swap
meet for 50 cents, and it was "The Magic of Mathematics" or something like
that. It was a low-level book and it got me started again. I do math as a
backdrop. I'm kind of compulsive about building things, making things, and
dBASE was one of those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.foxprohistory.org/interview_wayne_ratliff.htm"&gt;Interview with Wayne Ratliff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He wrote dBase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-i-was-a-computer"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;I was a computer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Wayne Ratliff: Computers themselves got me away from car design. Before I
completed my degree, I got a job with Martin Marietta in Denver. I was a
computer. My job title was computer. Other people have programmed
computers, but I have been one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-databases-and-natural-language-research"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Databases and Natural Language Research&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I went out and bought lots of books on natural language and artificial
intelligence. I kept getting drawn from one place to another, and I did lots
of experiments. I hadn't researched the database as much as I did the
natural-language aspect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-self-reflection"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;self-reflection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The way I've programmed all my life is as a toolmaker. When I compare
myself, even ten years ago, with other programmers, I see that I was trying
to generalize to a large extent; they were trying to write programs that
would solve a specific need. Their programs would frequently be delivered
much sooner than mine would be, but mine would have longer lifetimes. Once
the specific need went away, their programs were dead, they had to be
rewritten each time the needs changed. I always wrote in such a way that the
program could solve a family of problems, rather than just a single one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-hacker"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;hacker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Wayne Ratliff: Yes. Do you think hacker is a good word or a bad word? If you
think it's a good word, then they're hackers. They're good people, but
they're thinking of their job rather than the user, and you have to go a
little beyond that. That's how dBASE got started. I was thinking of how I
wanted to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.randomhacks.net/2005/10/11/amb-operator/"&gt;amb operator in lisp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a neat concept to understand. The ruby code made it clear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-job-search"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;job search&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I could go on bemoaning the many disappointing experiences I had on this
slog of a job search. There were many of them. 23 interviews and I didn’t
get a single offer. I have always sought to be completely honest and humble
with myself and others about my abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a similar experience after getting fired from twitter. I attend 20-30 interviews and I managed to clear one.
The experience frustrated me to no end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My personal experience at Square interview was one of humiliation. I was escorted out after the 1st round as I could
not write code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-cottage-industry"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;cottage industry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;There is a cottage industry springing up around passing interviews - All of
this algorithm challenge hubub started with popular companies like Google.
There were several engineers who worked at these popular tech companies that
saw an opportunity to make a few bucks be offering prep material. There were
two influential books written on the subject: Cracking the Coding Interview and
Elements of Programming Interviews. Both of these books offer guided interview
preparation material. The problem is that the industry got a hold of these
books and tailored their interviews to the book’s material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is real. So many start-ups help you prepare for the interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-acceptance"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Acceptance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Complaining about it wont do any good.  - Sooner or later I’m going to have to
get another job. Even if I don’t like the methodology, I am going to have to go
through the loop again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final conclusions makes it a balanced article, in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no good way to find the right candidates. These interviews of-course help test if the candidate can code,
has prepared for the interview and is taking the process seriously. I am with this process until we find a better one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;Ordering Gaurantees&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ZooKeeper has two basic ordering guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Linearizable writes: All requests that update the state of  ZooKeeper  are
serializable  and  respect precedence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;FIFO client order: All requests from a given client are executed  in the
order  that  they  were  sent  by  the client.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The important design of the Zookeeper was in the Client API used by the clients, server is a well defined architecture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Zookeeper for the Packer service, which is a service to manage artifacts on Aurora scheduler (on Mesos)  at
twitter. ZK was used along with hadoop for storing package metadata. This was overkill for simple operation, and it
was decided migrate the service from ZK to a relational database like MySQL.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had worked on the client of this service in python and also wrote certain parts the migration client in java.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-intended-use"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;intended use&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;It is intended for use within a loosely-coupled distributed system consisting
of moderately large numbers of small machines connected by a high-speed
network. For example, a Chubby instance (also known as a Chubby cell) might
serve ten thousand 4-processor machines connected by 1Gbit/s Ethernet. Most
Chubby cells are confined to a single data centre or machine room, though we do
run at least one Chubby cell whose replicas are separated by thousands of
kilometres.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-backup"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;backup&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Every few hours, the master of each Chubby cell writes a snapshot of its
database to a GFS file server in a different building. The use of a
separate building ensures both that the backup will survive building damage,
and that the backups introduce no cyclic dependencies in the system; a GFS cell
in the same building potentially might rely on the Chubby cell for electing its
master.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-time-safety"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;time safety&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;I see choosing "new" languages (or frameworks) as very risky propositions to
the life of a project. These languages are less likely to be around in ten or
twenty years time (newer and better Rusts and Gos are likely to form in the
years ahead) and in the meantime require you to constantly expend effort to
prevent your projects from being turned into a brick by
language/environment/library changes. In contrast my old C projects from 5-8
years ago still compile and run, with one particular example only needing a
small modification. It's not perfect, but C is much more likely to be the
"safe" option if time x usefulness of your project is a goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Argues that we spend time quickly adopting new languages and frameworks, take it for granted that anything we write
will be short-lived. Author argues that it is wrong philosophy to adopt, and I agree with him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose to experiment, but build something that lasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://lists.mindrot.org/pipermail/openssh-unix-announce/2020-February/000138.html"&gt;OpenSSH 8.2 released&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-rsa-compromise"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;rsa compromise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is now possible[1] to perform chosen-prefix attacks against the
SHA-1 algorithm for less than USD$50K. For this reason, we will be
disabling the "ssh-rsa" public key signature algorithm by default in a
near-future release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The better alternatives include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The RFC8332 RSA SHA-2 signature algorithms rsa-sha2-256/512. These
algorithms have the advantage of using the same key type as
"ssh-rsa" but use the safe SHA-2 hash algorithms. These have been
supported since OpenSSH 7.2 and are already used by default if the
client and server support them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ssh-ed25519 signature algorithm. It has been supported in
OpenSSH since release 6.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;The RFC5656 ECDSA algorithms: ecdsa-sha2-nistp256/384/521. These
have been supported by OpenSSH since release 5.7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We definitely need a better name for these algorithms. RSA, the term, is so much easier to remember and associate than
SHA-2, ED25519, and ECDSA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ramsey did all this, and more, in an alarmingly short lifespan. He died at the

contracted by swimming in the river Cam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;Rather than focus on a ‘oneness’ or God, like his brother Michael, he thought
the good life was to be found within our human, fallible, ways of being.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="admonition admonition-once-a-mathematician-always-a-mathematician"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;once a mathematician, always a mathematician&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At its heart, mathematics is about understanding the underlying structure
inherent in a given area of interest —and where no such structure exists —to
deﬁne the minimal structure that is needed to make forward progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The phases involved in the creative process were ﬁrst described by German
physiologist Herman Helmholtz in the late nineteenth century. He identiﬁed
three stages of creativity:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;saturation,
incubation and
illumination&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;These three stages have since been augmented with the additional step of
veriﬁcation by the scientiﬁc community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="admonition admonition-mathematical-techniques-are-algorithms"&gt;
&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;mathematical techniques are algorithms&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speciﬁc mathematical techniques e.g., differentiation, integration or the
Simplex method are algorithms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol class="last arabic simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;To truly appreciate an algorithm and understand how it works, one needs to
be able to run it by hand on a representative set of examples.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In mathematics, this translates to being able to differentiate or integrate
a given expression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The latter requires a set of semi-mechanical steps and this is where one
uses aids such as scratch memory provided by pencil and paper —something for
which I needed to compensate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;However, a true understanding of the underlying algorithm is far more
important than any speciﬁc technique that one might devise for running the
algorithm on speciﬁc instances.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could relate to author's experience in solving some problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Finding the day of the week. I went by the logic that, 1st January of 1900 was a Monday, and then I figured out
hte day of the week. This problem was given in the book, Let us C, by Yashwant Kanetkar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Playing a nimm like game. I had a designed a similar game called 21-match stick game in the college. It was a very
simple game, wherein the player forced to pick the last match stick looses. This was again from the exercise in the
Yashwant Kanetkar book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I recollect, I think, I had a good saturation phase in reading the "Let us C" book by reading, reviewing.
Incubation by trial and errors, and development of the game itself was illumninatiom and when I let my friends play
it, it was the verification stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="first admonition-title"&gt;cost of ideas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="last"&gt;You won't live long enough to learn more than a tiny fraction of all there is
to know. Ideas have costs in the time it takes to learn them, the amount of
maintenance required to remember them and the amount of effort it takes to
apply them. Prefer ideas that have a high power-to-cost ratio.&lt;/p&gt;

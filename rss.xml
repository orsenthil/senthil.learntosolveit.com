&lt;p&gt;I graduated from OMSCS, Online Masters in Computer Science Program from Georgia
Tech. I accomplished my personal goal of a Masters in Computer Science from a
reputed university.  I got admitted into this program in 2014 and continued to
take one class per 15-week term. I decided to go a few extra miles by taking
three classes more than required, and graduated with a specialization in both
"Computational Perception and Robotics," and "Software Systems."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My journey&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My desire to do a master's in computer science was one of my first wishes in my
career.  I did my schooling and college in India. I had missed going to a
reputed college. So, I started trying to get into a Masters in Computer
Science. I failed in 2002 in my first attempt. I started working and earning
money. I took courses and tried again in 2003 and failed. I must have tried yet
again in 2004 and failed. My understanding of the subjects, and more
importantly, my planning skills were feeble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started taking courses as I could not give up on my desire to learn Computer
Science. I took Continuing Education Proficiency Courses from IISc offered on
Wednesday evenings. These courses paved the way for me to get into a CPython
Development through Google Summer of Code program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had not achieved my desired goal of getting into a master's program in
Computer Science. So, I started trying again in 2007. After having work
experience, having four patents from work, having done part-time courses, I
applied again. This time for US universities. I tried for 10 universities in
2007 and got rejected by all of them. In 2008, I tried again for 5 universities
and got rejected by them. I went for it in 2009 and did not get into any of the
5 universities.  In 2010, I got one admit through referral, but I decided not
to pursue it as it was not suitable for me. In 2012, I almost enrolled in a
part-time master's program but did not pursue it as it was not Computer
Science.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/x2x2zyk9rigcxck/IMG_20191213_180112.jpg" class="align-right" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/x2x2zyk9rigcxck/IMG_20191213_180112.jpg" style="width: 400px; height: 600px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014, the OMSCS program was launched, and it looked very promising. I
applied, and I got an admit in its second offering. I took it up. I started my
classes in Jan 2015, and after taking 13 courses, completed it in December
2019.  I have a GPA of 3.21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My most important learning during this course was my failure (getting a C) in
Computational Photography due to a mistake I did. I could have been out of the
program, but I became careful, corrected myself, and retook the course to get B
grade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The experience has shaped me well as a person. The journey was fun, eventful.
My family, my wife, Shalini, supported me a lot. She would regularly check-in
with my plans and plan our social outings accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had celebrated our first Kid, Siddhartha's 1st birthday, when I had started
this program. We had our second kid, Saharsha, while I was doing the courses.
Keeping them entertained while doing masters is challenging.  I used to put
them to sleep and then return back to my computer for completing the assignments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In terms of work, I had lost a job, got a new job, and then changed a new
one during this timeframe. I struggled a bit to balance work
and study but managed to concentrate on work and not let one disturb the plans
of the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we celebrated my graduation with a family trip to Atlanta, and my wife
Shalini organized a party with our friends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2020/01/04/graduated.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 05 Jan 2020 07:09:10 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: The Great Scientists in Bite-sized Chunks</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/12/29/book-review-the-great-scientists-in-bite-sized-chunks.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31707724-the-great-scientists-in-bite-sized-chunks" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="The Great Scientists in Bite-sized Chunks" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1472549442l/31707724._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31707724-the-great-scientists-in-bite-sized-chunks"&gt;The Great Scientists in Bite-sized Chunks&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1537744.Meredith_MacArdle"&gt;Meredith MacArdle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

A simple book gives an overview of many scientists and explains their achievements within a page. The book is divided into categories such as Astronomy, Physics, Biology, Environment, etc, and goes from the earliest changemaker in this field to the latest. It is very easy to see how each of the scientists stood on top of the research done by the previous one, sometimes in a different field. The personal characteristics and the challenges faced by these scientists in their respective eras were entertaining to read.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In terms of personal characteristics, Roentgen, after discovering X-rays, had refused to benefit financially from his discovery believing that it should be freely available to all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wanted to note down Rudolf Virchow's view, wherein he believes: "Medicine is a social science, and politics is nothing else but medicine on a large scale".

This book helped me get into Deep Learning. This is a high-level overview that any software engineer will desire as we try to understand “this new world” (even as of 2019). The terms in new-world are used in multiple Medium articles, and github.io pages and github.com READMEs, and we wonder what any of these have to do with solving the problem, how does it fit in, etc. This book took a top-down approach to explain it all and help me made sense of every article that I read about Deep Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Artificial Intelligence as of 2019. I like to thank the Authors for their invaluable and accessible contribution to this field of AI and Neural Networks.

I picked this book to gain some structured knowledge of docker. I had done a costly mistake with docker, and I realized, it was because my knowledge of docker was mostly by trial and error, reading the docs and trying it out. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book focusses on operational aspects of docker. This is perhaps aimed at the beginners of docker who want to pick and learn the commands. Experienced users might find that this book goes more into breadth than depth.&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/10/07/book-review-docker-up-and-running-by-karl-matthias-sean-p-kane.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 16:36:01 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Certified Kubernetes Administrator</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/10/06/certified-kubernetes-administrator.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am a CNCF certified Kubernetes administrator now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not clear the exam in the first attempt, came close to clearing in the second attempt, did a horrible docker mistake in my third attempt.
In my third attempt I ran a sleep 3600 when with &lt;cite&gt;-it&lt;/cite&gt; flag flag on for docker run, and I could not exit or kill the shell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, cleared the exam in my fourth attempt. It is fun a exam for someone interested in Kubernetes to take.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/10/06/certified-kubernetes-administrator.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 06:20:06 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Kubernetes Up and Running</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/10/06/book-review-kubernetes-up-and-running.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26759355-kubernetes" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Kubernetes: Up &amp;amp; Running" src="https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1515495557l/26759355._SX98_.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26759355-kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes: Up &amp;amp; Running&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14404787.Kelsey_Hightower"&gt;Kelsey Hightower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This book is a straightforward narration by Georgia Takei of a Japanese Internment by the US Government during World War II. George and his family had suffered this cruelty. He highlights how opportunistic senators took chances to rise to power by promoting racial discrimination.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I had not known about this part of US history. I also did not know how ACLU helped the Japenese in the US then. US had detained 250,000 Japanese families living in the US, many of them US citizens, into camps during WWII.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Having lived through this horror, a lot of these Japanese families restarted and rebuilt their lives again. George Takei turned to activism to share his story with the masses, and I think he has been very effective.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book has come the right time when similar mistreatment is being carried out by certain opportunistic politicians.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2019/10/06/book-review-they-called-us-enemy-by-george-takei.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 07 Oct 2019 05:29:14 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

This is my personal domain that hosts [my blog](https://xtoinfinity.com/) and the [RSS reader I use to read news](http://news.xtoinfinity.com/).
It is powered by [Nikola](https://getnikola.com/)

I actively share about articles, research papers I read, review books, and sometimes explain things I find interesting.

It is called **x** **to** **infinity** with the logo ![logo](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/9wfngl1x5h25309/xtoinfinity-logo2.png) to denote,
my blog, a representation of my mind, is a [mathematical function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)) on _any concept_, denoted by element `x` as it approaches the [mathematical limits](https://www.mathsisfun.com/calculus/limits.html) to [infinity](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/infinity.html).

I hope you will enjoy reading it.

<p>Found this introductory post on <a class="reference external" href="https://thesocietea.org/2016/12/core-functional-programming-concepts/">core functional programming concepts</a> dealing with the subject succinctly.
It is easy to approach functional programming, if we can recognize the following concepts held true by all the
functional programs, and languages facilitating them.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p class="first">Functions are Pure</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No side-effects, like printing something from the function.</li>
<li>When called with the same input, will always return the same output. We take that for granted, isn't it?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Functions are first-class and are of higher order.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Treat function names as variables.</li>
<li>Toss function (names) as an argument to a function, and as a return value from a function.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Variables are immutable.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Forget mutating variables in a program. If you want an updated value, create a new variable. When you are
getting started with programming, you feel this is questionable. With experience under your belt, you start
to prefer immutability of variables.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Functions have referential transparency.</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It follows from functions are pure requirement. The referential transparency requirement is about substituting
the function call with return value, wherever the function is called, should not change the state of the program.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p class="first">Lambda Calculus</p>
<blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The mathematics behind functional programming. Take arguments and have a return valued. When evaluating multiple
arguments, the function is evaluated one argument at a time, with result send to next one-arg-less function,
kind of a tail-recursion. This concept is called currying.</li>
</ul>

<p>I stumbled upon a <a class="reference external" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5kbvkj/eli5_why_is_suspension_from_school_a_punishment/">Explain Like I am Five Story which dealt with the rationale behind punishments</a>.  The topic of
punishments is a complex one and needs balanced thinking. The author elucidated many reasons for which punishments are
administered in society. We see the trends of those in both online and offline societies.</p>
<p>Punishments are administered for one of the following reasons.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Incapacitation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is stopping somebody from doing an unacceptable behavior in the society again.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Restitution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is getting something back for the victim of somebody who misbehaves, to compensate them for that which they've been
deprived by the offender. Like charging fine and using it for taxes.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Retribution</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is like feeling of justice that deprived might get. Many of us think, this is the primary purpose for punishment. This
is non measurable, but often paves way to other measurable impacts like incapacitation, restitution etc.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Rehabilitation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The purpose is to give the offender, time to reflect on the wrong doing, possibly empathize with the one affected.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Deterrence</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Is about reducing the likelihood that misbehaviour will occur in the first place. The punishment is more for a warning
to prevent a socially unacceptable behavior.</p>
<p>Many a social regulatory policies can be mapped to above concepts of negative reinforcements to prevent any undesirable
outcomes.</p>

            </header><div class="e-content entry-content">
                    <div>
<p>This post is a short discussion on the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport">Leslie Lamport</a> 's paper "<a class="reference external" href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/teaching-concurrency.pdf">Teaching Concurrency</a>".</p>
<p>Lamport's basic premise is that understanding the system the most important part, and engineers often muddy their
understanding with implementation details as soon as they start talking about programming languages suitable for
concurrency.</p>
<p>He even challenges engineers to come up with the solution for concurrency problems without using "<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)">semaphores</a>",
"<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monitor_(synchronization)">monitors</a>", or any other construct that were invented and provided as a tool. Using those, he says, is like using the
'sort' to routine the language to implement a sorting algorithm.</p>
<blockquote>
The modern field of concurrency started with Dijkstra’s 1965 paper on the mutual exclusion problem. For most of the
1970s, one “solved” the mutual exclusion problem by using semaphores or monitors or conditional critical regions or
some other language construct. This is like solving the sorting problem by using a programming language with a sort
command. Most of your colleagues can explain how to implement mutual exclusion using a semaphore. How many of them
can answer the following question: Can one implement mutual exclusion without using lower-level constructs that,
like semaphores, assume mutually exclusive access to a resource?</blockquote>
<p>Lamport's approach to problem solving suggests, we need to think of computing problem as series of states instead of
series of steps. I think, series of steps tend to give some linearity the approach, while series of states tend to
indicate that sub-parts of the system can have multiple states and the next state each sub-part can take only depends
upon the current state and action that leads the state transition to the next state.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is more useful to think about states than sequences of steps because what a computing device does next depends on
its current state, not on what steps it took in the past.</p>
<p>To describe a computation we need to describe a sequence of states. More often, we need to describe the set of
computations that can be produced by some particular computing device, such as an algorithm. There is one method that
works in practice: describing a set of computations by</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>the set of all initial initial states and</li>
<li>A next-state relation that describes, for every state, the possible next states that is, the set of states
reachable from that state by a single step.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>On computational thinking.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How should we describe computations?</p>
<p>Most computer scientists would probably interpret this question to mean, what language should we use? Imagine an
art historian answering “how would you describe impressionist painting?” by saying “in French”.</p>
<p>Programming and hardware-design languages don’t help an engineer understand what problem a system should solve.
Thinking of computations as sequences of states, rather than as something described by a language, is the first
step towards such understanding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lamport also describes in great details about importance of problem specification. Sometimes, when the problem is
specified clearly and understood problem, the solution becomes easy.  Most of our struggles seems to be with coming to
grasp the problem specification.</p>
<blockquote>
The great contribution of Dijkstra’s paper on mutual exclusion was not his solution; it was stating the problem.
(It is remarkable that, in this first paper on the subject, Dijkstra stated all the requirements that distinguish
mutual exclusion from fundamentally simpler and less interesting problems.)</blockquote>
<p><em>On concurrency, itself</em></p>
<p>He gives an example of concurrency problem  that according to him is "trivial". It took me some reading to understand
the problem. <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24989756/what-is-the-inductive-invariant-of-the-simple-concurrent-program">StackOverflow.com</a> certainly helped.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Once an engineer understands what a computation is and how it is described, she can understand the most important
concept in concurrency: invariance. A computing device does the correct thing only because it maintains a correct
state. Correctness of the state is expressed by an invariant—a predicate that is true in every state of every
computation.</p>
<p>Invariance is the key to understanding concurrent systems, but few engineers or computer scientists have learned to
think in terms of invariants. Here is a simple example.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Now, the problem</strong></p>
<p>Consider N processes numbered from 0 through N − 1 in which each process i executes</p>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}
x[i] :=1;
\end{equation*}
</div>
<div class="math">
\begin{equation*}

y[i] := x[(i-1)modN]
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>and stops, where each <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> initially equals 0. (The reads and writes of each <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> are assumed to be
atomic.)</p>
<p>This algorithm satisfies the following property: after every process has stopped, <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> equals 1 for at least
one process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> .</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the algorithm satisfies this property; the last process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> to write <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> must set
it to 1. But that process doesnt set <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> to 1 because it was the last process to write y.</p>
<p>What a process does depends only on the current state, not on what processes wrote before it. The algorithm satisfies
this property because it maintains an inductive invariant.</p>
<p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
<p>The explanation on how <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> equals for 1 at least one process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> goes like this.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The <span class="math">\(x_s\)</span> model the following behavior: <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> is 1 if and only if the process <span class="math">\(i\)</span> has already run.</li>
<li>After all processes have completed, all <span class="math">\(x_s\)</span> are thus set to 1.</li>
<li>The <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> are a bit trickier: <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is set if <span class="math">\(x[i-1]\)</span> was set, that is, <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is 1 if and
only if the predecessor of <span class="math">\(i\)</span> had already run when <span class="math">\(i\)</span> was doing its write to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I essentially to had resort to <a class="reference external" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24989756/what-is-the-inductive-invariant-of-the-simple-concurrent-program">StackOverflow.com</a> post author's explanation to completely understand this.</p>
<p>The program invariant is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a process has set <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span>, it must already have set <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span> to 1.
This is true regardless whether <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is set to 0 or 1.</p>
<p>Proving this invariant is quite easy: In the beginning, none of the <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> is set, so it holds trivially.
During program execution, each write to <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> is <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_point">sequenced after</a> a write to <span class="math">\(x[i]\)</span>. Therefore
the invariant also holds for every step of the program afterwards.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The further reasoning goes like this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The last process to finish sets <span class="math">\(y[i]\)</span> to 1 because, by definition of being the last process, its
predecessor must have already finished execution at that point (ie. its y value is already set).</p>
<p>Which means, because of the invariant, its <span class="math">\(x\)</span> value (which determines the last process' <span class="math">\(y\)</span> value)
has to be 1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The alternate way to look at this problem can give some intuitive understanding too.</p>
<blockquote>
You cannot find an execution order in which all <span class="math">\(y_s\)</span> are set to 0. Doing so would require all processes to
execute before their predecessor. However, since our processes are arranged in a ring (that is, if I follow the
predecessor chain I will eventually end up at my starting point again), this leads to the contradiction that at
least one process must have finished executing before it wrote to <span class="math">\(y\)</span>.</blockquote>
<p>To understand this concurrency problem, it requires some notion of syntax, a prior understanding of proving hypothesis,
and possibly discussing the problem and solution.</p>
<p>Trying to understand itself, I guess, is a progress.</p>

<p>"Myth of a Strong Leader" by Archie Brown is from Bill Gates book recommendation. Pause a moment and think about the title. Every now and then you will hear something saying "Strong Leader", you  never hear people saying "we need a weak leader".</p>
<p>The book's title is that, the concept of "Strong Leader" is a myth.
According to the book, an effective person works by collaboration, flexibility and never becomes a center point of decision making.</p>

<p>In this short TED talk video, Salman Khan pitches for mastery based learning. It means that if there is a bar (say
100%) for mastery, then the variable in the learning should be how many hours one spends to attain that bar. Until the
bar of 100% mastery is attained, the student should not be considered the master of the subject, and should not just
move on the next class/course.</p>
<p>We adopted the current system because it was impractical for mastery based learning previously, but given our
computational resources, mastery based learning is very much practical today.</p>

<p>Parkinson's is not curable (yet). Folks with Parkinsons will have a progressively degenerating muscular order.
But I have seen folks with Parkinsons live for very long time with only slight impairment.</p>
<p>It's well knowm it is a brain disorder and caused due to stress. There is a recent news (<a class="reference external" href="http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38173287">http://www.bbc.com/news/health-38173287</a>) that it might due to bacteria in the gut. If it were due to bacteria in the gut, then the cure is near.</p>

<p>This article in <a class="reference external" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/opinion/dalai-lama-behind-our-anxiety-the-fear-of-being-unneeded.html?_r=0">new york times</a> by Dalai Lama was a good one to read. I collected these important points from the article.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A small hint comes from interesting research about how people thrive. In one shocking experiment, researchers found that senior citizens who didn’t feel useful to others were nearly three times as likely to die prematurely as those who did feel useful. This speaks to a broader human truth: We all need to be needed.</li>
<li>Being “needed” does not entail selfish pride or unhealthy attachment to the worldly esteem of others. Rather, it consists of a natural human hunger to serve our fellow men and women. As the 13th-century Buddhist sages taught, “If one lights a fire for others, it will also brighten one’s own way.”</li>
<li>Feeling superfluous is a blow to the human spirit. It leads to social isolation and emotional pain, and creates the conditions for negative emotions to take root.</li>
<li>Indeed, what unites the two of us in friendship and collaboration is not shared politics or the same religion. It is something simpler: a shared belief in compassion, in human dignity, in the intrinsic usefulness of every person to contribute positively for a better and more meaningful world.</li>

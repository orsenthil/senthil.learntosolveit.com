<p>Nice see my first article in the Dell PowerSolutions Journal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps4q04-20040115-Kumaran.pdf">Using Log Messages and alert actions in Dell OpenManage Server Administrator</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Its not very technical, can be read and understood with ease.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hope it is helpful to the system administrators using OpenManage and invokes some curiosity in others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hope you enjoy reading it!</p>

<p>Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small<br><em>trivial</em> project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you<br>do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than<br>it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the<br>sheer size of the work you envision. <br><br>So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big<br>picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate<br>need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to<br>jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get<br>something half-way <em>useful</em> first, and then others will say "hey, that<br><em>almost</em> works for me", and they'll get involved in the project. <br><br>And if there is anything I've learnt from Linux, it's that projects have<br>a life of their own, and you should <em>not</em> try to enforce your "vision"<br>too strongly on them. Most often you're wrong anyway, and if you're not<br>flexible and willing to take input from others (and willing to change<br>direction when it turned out your vision was flawed), you'll never get<br>anything good done. <br><br>In other words, be willing to admit your mistakes, and don't expect to<br>get anywhere big in any kind of short timeframe. I've been doing Linux<br>for thirteen years, and I expect to do it for quite some time still. If<br>I had <em>expected</em> to do something that big, I'd never have started. It<br>started out small and insignificant, and that's how I thought about it.<br><br>- Linus Benedict Torvalds<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Linus has written a nice article at lwn. It is interesting to read and its about Management. Its titled Linus on kernel management and deals with management in genral. </p>
<p><br>He oftens says,(I have read him saying) that he is more of a manager for the kernel now rather than core developer.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>It goes...</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><span style="font-style:italic;">First off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful</span></p>

<p><br>(*) This document does so not so much by answering the question, but by</p>
<p><br>making it painfully obvious to the questioner that we don't have a clue</p>

<li>Bill Gates and his company get a lot of people at Sun Microsystems up in the morning. <i>Scott McNealy </i>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li> I am not against Bill Gates the man, but he's playing a historical role that demands a harsh critique. Within his lifetime, Bill will have probably acquired, by accident, a kind of power that has been rarely sought and never before achieved. The medieval popes sought to be the intermediaries for all thought and communication, even as they were the patrons of the elite intellectuals of their day. They serve as the best precedent we have for what is truly an unprecedented situation. In twenty or fifty years, when most human affairs, intimate and grand, are conducted via computer operating systems, Microsoft could become the universal gatekeeper of thought. Microsoft has so far not been malevolent when it has exercised editorial power. But absolute power corrupts absolutely, and Microsoft could well end up with a new type of absolute power.<i>Jaron Lanier</i>
<p><br></p>
</li>
<li>: Bill Gates is a prime example of the power of a smart person being focused on exactly what he wants. He accomplishes his goals while the rest of us are just muddling around. Watching Bill operate makes me realize, for better or worse, how unfocused I am.<i>Danny Hills</i>

<br>You asked:<br><br>        ``Tell me what I should do in order to keep strong feelings<br>        towards C.''<br>Permit me to babble out a few random thoughts ...<br><br>Write programs for other people.<br><br>Where possible, openly publish your code, perhaps on your web site. The<br>http://freshmeat.net/ site is a good place to announce new code. (It is<br>a strange web site name, but they are legit and THE place to announce<br>new code). Support the code that you publish.<br><br>Start small and work your way up ... Some of my more popular code is<br>actually small code fragments that are used by others over and over<br>again.<br><br>Don't be discouraged if nobody (or if only a few people) uses some of<br>your early programs. What is important is to practice writing quality,<br>well commented code ... to maintain and fix that code.<br>.....<br><br>I found this really useful and inspirational once again.<br>http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/c/expert.html<br><br>Thanks Chongo!<br><br>I take it again.<br><br>

Named for the British physicist who<br>&gt; designed it, a Josephson junction exploits the phenomenon of<br>&gt; superconductivity, the ability of certain materials to conduct<br>&gt; electric current with practically zero resistance. Josephson junctions<br>&gt; are used in certain specialized instruments such as highly-sensitive<br>&gt; microwave detectors, magnetometers, and QUIDs.  A Josephson junction<br>&gt; is made up of two superconductors, separated by a nonsuperconducting<br>&gt; layer so thin that electrons can cross through the insulating<br>&gt; barrier. The flow of current between the superconductors in the<br>&gt; absence of an applied voltage is called a Josephson current, and the<br>&gt; movement of electrons across the barrier is known as Josephson<br>&gt; tunneling. Two or more junctions joined by superconducting paths form<br>&gt; what is called a Josephson interferometer.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; While researching superconductivity, Brian David Josephson studied the<br>&gt; properties of a junction between two superconductors. Following up on<br>&gt; earlier work by Leo Esaki and Ivar Giaever, he demonstrated that in a<br>&gt; situation when there is electron flow between two superconductors<br>&gt; through an insulating layer (in the absence of an applied voltage),<br>&gt; and a voltage is applied, the current stops flowing and oscillates at<br>&gt; a high frequency.<br>&gt; <br>&gt; The Josephson effect is influenced by magnetic fields in the vicinity,<br>&gt; a capacity that enables the Josephson junction to be used in devices<br>&gt; that measure extremely weak magnetic fields, such as superconducting<br>&gt; quantum interference devices (SQUIDs). For their efforts, Josephson,<br>&gt; Esaki, and Giaever shared the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1973.<br>&gt; ------- End of forwarded message -------<br>&gt; <br>&gt; -- <br>&gt; Denis Howe <br>&gt; Free On-Line Dictionary of Computing<br>&gt; http://www.foldoc.org/<br>Put your brain in gear before starting your mouth in motion.<br>Rocky's Lemma of Innovation Prevention: Unless the results are known in<br>advance, funding agencies will reject the proposal.<br><br></p>

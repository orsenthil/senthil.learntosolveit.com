<p>This article titled, <a class="reference external" href="http://wtarreau.blogspot.com/2006/11/making-applications-scalable-with-load.html">"Making applications scalable with Load Balancing"</a>
by the author of the famous software <a class="reference external" href="http://www.haproxy.org/">HAProxy</a> introduces
the concept of load-balancing and talks about the need for load-balancing.</p>
<div class="section" id="definitions">
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p><em>Scaling</em> - Since the power of any server is limited, a web application must be able to run on
multiple servers to accept an ever increasing number of users. this is called as scaling. when
application is running on internet, the site's maintainer has to find ways to spread the load
on several servers, either through internal mechanisms, external components or via re-design.</p>
<p><em>Load Balancing</em> - Load Balancing is the ability make several
servers participate in the same service and do the same work.</p>
<p><em>High Availability</em> - The ability to maintain unaffected service during
any previous number of simultaneous failures is called high availability.</p>
<p>The point is, <em>load balancing</em> and <em>high availability</em> are different.</p>
<p>The article focuses the different load-balancing options, gives details on Layer 3/4 load balancer, Layer 7 load
balancer and where those are used.</p>

For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. <br><br>This book might be a quick, due to
glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.<br></span>

I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.</span>

This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.<br><br>The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/863064457">4 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
This book belongs to the genre of Space-opera. Plenty of drama, plot twists, hero, heroine and plot twist. I think, I read it twice, and I enjoyed the book when I read it the second time.</span>

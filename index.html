<p>In any decision making, being right, getting things right seems intimidating. For human decisions, being right is
debatable too. Being less wrong appears desirable and achievable. If a person is committed to non-perfectionist
philosophy, then being less wrong falls right into his stride.</p>

It teaches you to be careful in what you emit and to be skeptical of what you receive.
It doesn't tell you what is right, it teaches you how to think and to become less wrong.
And to do so is in your own self interest ...

This book is written by my parents, so my obvious bias there. It chooses many good Sourashtra Recipes and presents them. The presentation is good. The language, editing can be improved.

<p>I have been involved with Spastics Society Of Karnataka for more than 10 years. Today, we launched a new website
for the organization. Please check this out <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a></p>
<div class="section" id="a-bit-of-history">
<h2>A bit of history</h2>
<p>Let's use <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayback_Machine">wayback machine</a> to look at how this evolved.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>When I inherited this project, the <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20040521200831/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">website looked like this in 2004</a>. I don't remember the technology, but it was
done by a volunteer by name Mr. Nagaraj. He transfered the hosting and domain from  Net 4 India to us.</li>
<li>Then sometime <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523104054/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org">in 2007 the website started looking like this</a> - I don't remember the technology that I used. It seems
I was using <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070523172324/http://www.oswd.org:80/">open source web design</a>  and looks like I hand-coded it.</li>
<li>In 2008, we moved entirely to <a class="reference external" href="https://edu.google.com/k-12-solutions/g-suite/?modal_active=none">Google Apps for Education</a> - this was a great move. It facilitated online
processing, official email ids, all our data in a single place. This was like migrating Spastics Society of Karnataka
to the "Cloud". The website changed its <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">look to this in 2008</a> using google sites.</li>
<li>The google sites website was not very pleasant looking. <a class="reference external" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160721031435/http://www.spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org:80/">This time in 2013, I updated website to wordpress</a>, and
hosted on bluehost.com and our domains were migrated to Google Domains. The wordpress website also had
accessibility features on changing font, style etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>There was problem, wordpress is not the most secure of the software that is present today. We got <a class="reference external" href="https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!msg/webmasters/YayR1-iZ3x0/73Ig3qiWEQAJ">hacked by chinese hackers</a> who put up malware in our site.
This wasn't good. I removed the phishing, and they could still get to us. This happened for 2 months and I felt a
lack of control with wordpress.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>We decided to shutdown and <strong>delete</strong> the wordpress site, and decided to rebuild it. For stop-gap, we directed
people to <a class="reference external" href="https://sites.google.com/a/spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/spastics-society-of-karnataka/Home">Google Sites website</a>
</li>
<li>This stop gap solution lasted for more than a year because I did not want to rebuild it entirely with wordpress again.</li>
<li>In 2016, I decided to hand-code it using <a class="reference external" href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://getnikola.com/">Nikola</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://orsenthil.github.io/sskweb/">built this</a> - This was hugely unappealing. It
was <strong>extremely secure and trustworthy</strong>, but felt very unappealing to everyone.</li>
<li>In 2018, we decided to make a appealing website, and this time I went with a hosted service, wix.com. The result is
what you see at <a class="reference external" href="http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/">http://spasticssocietyofkarnataka.org/</a>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="features">
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>This was a team effort. My friends Avinash and Nivedita got involved. We use Trello.com to track our tasks. From
school Preethi, and Priya  Madam and Sobha Madam got involved too. The website does not have <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus-factor</a> of 1 and
this is an incredible feature.</p>
<p>The website was mostly done by Avinash. He cannot use his hands, and <a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEwO17xd4eU">uses voice to operate his computer</a> So this
website was created using voice.</p>
<p>Simple theme, accessible on mobile and our google apps (cloud) still remain for forms, email and everything as it
is convenient to manage.</p>
<p>I believe this change is going to help school further. Given what I have shared above, this project is a living
entity, and will evolve with times.</p>

I got interested in reading this book after hearing about this from Robert Sapolsky in one of his lectures. He had a very high regard for this book and states it had a tremendous influence on him.<br><br>For me, I had to struggle reading this book. This introduces the field of Choas and presents the story and anecdotes of about 200 scientists who were involved with Choas. It's a challenge to present a cohesive story when someone is dealing with 200 investigators. I felt frequent disconnects between one paragraph after another. I could not follow the trail of the story, and in fact, I wondered if there is any story at all here. <br><br>The book tries to lay a case that even after understanding Classical physics, and Quantum physics, the scientists discovered new ways to reason about nature using non-linear equations which depended upon the initial conditions. The later part, the system of non-linear equations which depend upon the initial conditions is called as the Chaos Theory.<br><br>I noted down the following interesting quotes from this book.<br><br>“John Hubbard, exploring iterated functions and the infinite fractal wildness of the Mandelbrot set, considered chaos a poor name for his work, because it implied randomness. To him, the overriding message was that simple processes in nature could produce magnificent edifices of complexity without randomness. In nonlinearity and feedback lay all the necessary tools for encoding and then unfolding structures as rich as the human brain.”<br><br><br>“The Mandelbrot set obeys an extraordinarily precise scheme leaving nothing to chance whatsoever. I strongly suspect that the day somebody actually figures out how the brain is organized they will discover to their amazement that there is a coding scheme for building the brain which is of extraordinary precision. The idea of randomness in biology is just reflex.”<br><br>"Shallow ideas can be assimilated; ideas that require people to reorganize their picture of the world provoke hostility."<br><br><br></span>

<p>Interesting to watch this interview of 82 year old App Developer. She developed the app called <a class="reference external" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hinadan/id1199778491?mt=8">Hinadan</a> for people like her.</p>
<div class="youtube-video">

<p>Here is her story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wakamiya asked software developers to step in to develop her app. Uninterested, they suggested she make a game
herself. She took them up on the suggestion. Wakamiya soon bought programming books and
learned Apple’s Swift programming language through lessons with a programmer, nearly 200
miles away from her home in Japan's Kanagawa Prefecture, via Facebook Messenger and Skype.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time that Wakamiya took on a challenge.
She’s been dabbling in the tech field since the age of 60.</p>
<p>Upon retiring from a 43-year career as a bank clerk (she began at age 18), Wakamiya spent long hours caregiving
for her then-90-year-old mother. Feeling isolated, and seeking connection with the outside world, Wakamiya
bought her first computer, then moved on to a Microsoft PC, and later a Mac and iPhones. In between learning
the piano, at age 75, Wakamiya eventually joined a computer club for seniors, Mellow Club, learning to
create Excel art along the way. Then, this past year came Wakamiya’s focus on creating the game Hinadan.</p>
<p>The app, based on the annual Japanese doll festival of Hina Matsuri, invites players to arrange
12 ornamental dolls — representing the country’s emperor, family and guests — in a specific
order. The game requires in-depth memorization of various arrangements, and has become especially
popular with older women, who enjoy playing it with their grandchildren, Wakamiya said.</p>

<p>It is hard for me write a review for as a great a book as "Guns, Germs and Steel". I had not read anything like that
before. It just opened me up to a whole new level of experience, and new set of expectations from books.</p>
<p>I think, I picked it up after reading Bill Gates review about this.</p>
<p>"Like a lot of people, I was blown away by Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel. I had never read anything that explained
so much about human history." - <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/Guns-Germs-and-Steel">Bill Gates, On Guns, Germs and Steel</a></p>
<p>I made copious notes while reading this book, I wanted to preserve it for my future reference. I looked up many
different incidents in Wikipedia while reading this book. Every moment I spent was totally worth it. It will give a
reader a whole new understanding of the world. This book feels like a Magnum Opus, an experience provided to the reader.</p>
<p>The first captive thing presented to me in this book was <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Cajamarca">The Battle of Cajamarca</a> which lead to the fall of
the Inca Empire in South American Continent in 1500s.</p>
<p>Here is some data on this Battle. The left hand side is Spanish, and the right side is Inca Empire.</p>

What happened? The reader is taken through the reasons for such decisive victory.</p>
<p>Then it steps back and goes the reason for why some developments took place at the places it took place. This
flow-chart from the book conveys the reason in a comprehensive way.</p>
<img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/jo2c7hd29t9pg58/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.09.32.png?dl=0" class="align-center" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/jo2c7hd29t9pg58/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.09.32.png?dl=0" style="width: 450px; height: 600px;"><p>Then, a chapter on writing gives a whole history of human writing system. Which itself is fascinating, and the next
chapter was titled "Necessity's Mother".</p>
<p>This is an interesting twist on the commonly known proverb, "Necessity is the mother of all inventions". It just
asks, who was "Necessity's Mother". The answer is simple, it is the idle brain, curiosity. The chapter gives so many
details on the inventions that really took the world. I briefly wrote about it in this post <a class="reference external" href="http://xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/04/16/edison-and-his-phonograph.html">Edison and his phonograph</a>
when I was reading that chapter.</p>
<p>Then it deals with the idea of how the concept society and a religion must have formed. In the final chapters, it
goes into the fascinating story of China and Africa.</p>
<p>Here is one thing about China that amazed me.</p>
<img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/u8uejsmqffg7pol/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.20.09.png?dl=0" class="align-center" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/u8uejsmqffg7pol/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.20.09.png?dl=0"><p>Think about it, <strong>China sent huge ships with lots of people to expeditions way before Columbus set his foot on America!</strong></p>
<p>And the chapter on Africa, tells about the diversity of Africa, mentions about 1500 languages that originated in Africa.
And shares something that is very interesting.</p>
<img alt="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wpd57lbf26fxo3t/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.22.02.png?dl=0" class="align-center" src="https://dl.dropbox.com/s/wpd57lbf26fxo3t/Screenshot%202018-05-04%2002.22.02.png?dl=0"><p><strong>This just says two of modern religions of the world originated by the speakers of an African language.</strong></p>
<p>This book is an answer from Jared Diamond to his friend from Papau New Guinea, on why westerners were more advanced
than his tribe. <strong>It does a great job of giving that answer to Mr. Yali and rest of us.</strong></p>

<p>When I saw this tip in the IntelliJ, I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>Edison had invented <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonograph">phonograph</a>, a precursor to modern day music player and phone, but he not could get the proper
utility value of his invention immediately. I came across this paragraph in a book called, "Guns, Germs and Steel"
and felt compelled to note it down.</p>

Like most readers, I stumbled upon this book after taking Barbara Oakley's Learning How to Learn Course in Coursera. <br><br>This book reinforces the concepts taught in that course. The idea of relaxed learning, giving ourselves plenty of time while learning difficult concepts, avoiding procrastination, and tools that help us avoid the procrastination. The idea of repetition for remembering different concepts is presented and stressed well this book.<br><br>The importance of sleep for learning stayed with me and changed me when I took the course based on this book. I never discount sleep for important exams or deadlines now.<br><br>The crux of learning is expressed well by this quote from Santiago Ramón y Cajal introduced to us in this book<br><br><i><br>What a wonderful stimulant it would be for the beginner if his instructor, instead of amazing and dismaying him with the sublimity of great past achievements, would reveal instead the origin of each scientific discovery, the series of errors and missteps that preceded it - information that, from a human perspective, is essential to an accurate explanation of discovery. </i> - <b>Santiago Ramón y Cajal</b><br><br><br></span>

Narayan</a><br>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2771509811">5 of 5 stars</a><br><br>
This is Narayan's narration of the famous Indian Epic, Ramayana. It follows Valmiki's script, instead of the Kamban, that I thought, I would expect from the South Indian author. <br><br>The introduction gives the details of the Ramanand Sagar's Television series and how India stood still when Ramayan was telecast on weekends. The story is well know, but the best part of this book are in the details.<br><br>I liked the chapter on Vali and Sugreeva, wherein the author does not mince words and shares about the ethical lapse of Rama. That was a difficult chapter in Ramayana. Rama tries to help Sugreeva to fight against his brother Vali. He kills Vali by hiding. Rama being a warrior, is supposed to fight straight, and being righteous person, who is supposed to not harm anyone unnecessarily, forgoes both in this episode. Vali questions him about this. And Rama rationalizes that Vali is not a sub-human, Monkey, but a higher form since he possesses the judgement skills of Right vs Wrong, and since Vali choose the Wrong approaches, when knowing what was Right, he had to meet with this fate. Also, by having killed by Rama, Vali is elevated to higher form in his death.<br><br><br>Other mistakes of Rama are explained as a consequence of Rama forgetting his inherent divinity, making mistakes as a human, and needed constant reminders from gods. <br><br>This book is action packed, has good stories, morals, stories of ethical dilemmas and is entertaining. The author does a very good job of maintaining balance of religious piety and story telling in this book. <br><br></span>

<p>Looking Back at Postgres by Joseph M. Hellerstein (available here: <a class="reference external" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01973">https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01973</a> ) is an easy to
read, general paper on the Postgres development. It details, the design of Postgres database, and provides the details
on multiple inflection points into it's development. The very paragraph caught my attention.</p>
<p>Michael Stonebraker was the lead, and the designer of this system. But never wrote the code for this system, all coding
was done by students, and university programmers. Postgres, followed Michael Stonebraker's first system Ingres, and
turned out to be successful database system, that is now being developed by community of open source developers.</p>

This book reminded me of "The Road Ahead" by Bill Gates. This is an impressive account on Self Driving Technology, that is about to come and consume us in the near future. The book is very well written. Initially, I had plenty of doubts on the author, Lawrence D Burn's style, thinking that he was one of the pure management type guys, looking at things in a disconnected way, trying to associate himself with changes brought about by others. I was proven wrong. I started appreciating his insights, his outlook towards this project, his commitments, and really understood where he was coming from when the author provided more context into his own up bringing and background. He provided the view from Detroit, that many following the self-driving space will miss, and it an important viewpoint to consider.<br><br>The book starts with the DARPA race, narrates the events, and stories of people who are shaping this story. GM, and Google play a very important role in the story. The book shines in presenting, well researching personal accounts from various actors like Red Whitaker, Chris Urmson, Sebastian Thrun, Larry Page, Antony Levandowski, Travis Kalanick, as well as many people from the top management in established car companies. It was good to get a first hand account on how people running established businesses think, and make decisions. It also shares the grit, and adventures of engineers who work to push the envelop of the possibilities. The book indirectly highlights the value/policy stances taken by companies such as Waymo, Tesla, and Uber pursuing self driving technology after giving the backround on the limitations of the technology, which were known to everyone developing it. It should be noted that as of 2019, Tesla and Uber have both been responsible for loss of lives with their pursuit of this adventure, and both have escaped consequences for their mistakes.<br><br>With all the events, book lays the solid ground for what is to come and expected in the next few years or decades for Autonomy. I will count this book as one of the good business books that I have read in recent years.

<p>Most of us were attracted towards maths, science and programming because there was certain level of rigor,
factual information that can be verified by repeating the experiment, equality based on understanding of these facts,
and desire to elevate ourselves to the equal position of someone who had a better understanding of the facts that can
obtained by ourselves repeating the experiment, understanding the concepts and thereby understanding the greater sum.</p>
<p>Soon, as adults, we run into the <em>opinion territory</em>. What is considered an opinion vs fact is a topic in itself.
However, let us assume that opinion is different from mathematical fact.</p>
<p>When we run into opinion territory, the way the world works is, if a person has power over another, the person exercises
that power. We often find this irrational, argue in the <em>opinion territory</em> and try to find out if facts can be
established so that equality order can be restored.</p>
<p>Some scientist identify the opinion territory from science and choose to devote more of their energies to science,
aligned with what brought them to this interest in the first place.</p>

<p>I have known "by heart" that total number of the subsets of a set of n number is <span class="math">\(2^n\)</span>
I was struggling to find an intuitive explanation, and two answers helped me to understand it.</p>
<blockquote>
For each element, you have two choices: either you put it in your subset, or you don't; and these choices are all
independent.</blockquote>
<p>Citation:</p>
<p>Bruno Joyal (<a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12507/bruno-joyal">https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12507/bruno-joyal</a>), What is the proof that the total number of
subsets of a set is $2^n$?, URL (version: 2013-10-31): <a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417">https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417</a></p>
<p>Another was this table that represented the sets as binary, to denote 0 as an absence of the element and 1 as presence
of the element.</p>

Wow, what a book. It goes into multiple topics like being human, politics, religion, love, sex, community, spirituality, entrepreneurship, money, influence, negotiation, strategy and "understanding" of it all.<br><br>This gave a new word "grok" to English speaking people, which roughly means to "understand thoroughly" and becoming one with the concept.<br><br>One interesting thing about this science fiction is, it combined the real world concepts of business, stocks, politics, and ownership with imaginary situation where humans have already traveled to mars and there human of raised by martian among us. The details covering the rise of Mike to the status of a godman, and formation of his communion was fun read.<br><br>Just imagine how close is this quote "Thou art god, I am god. All that groks is god.” by Valentine Michael Smith to Sanskrit Verse "Tat Tvam Asi". <br><br>The character Jubal Harshaw, attributes that one can explain away everything by holding on solipsism, and pantheism.<br><br>I was impressed with Robert Heinlein covering so many topics. I really enjoyed it.<br></span>

This book covers a great deal on political leadership and helps the reader to understand the political landscape of multiple nations. The crux of this, it is not a strong leader that brings a net positive change, but a leader who is flexible, who understands the situation well, goes into the details, establishes that the processes, and follows it through that will bring the net positive change. The way, the different leaders have accomplished is quite varied, and depends on the situation and the time.<br><br>This book introduces some amazing real life characters like, Adolfo Suárez of spain who transformed the country to Democracy from the previously established monarchy in a peaceful manner. It also shares how Deng Xioping is the person behind the economic advancement of China from 1970 onward. It shares the perspective on how Fidel Castro overthrew the dictatorship in his country, and how lived by his principles, and did not accumulate any wealth for himself.<br><br>One thing that struck with me, when this book was written, Obama was the president of USA, and even then, the system in place in USA was such that, no one particular person was ultimately responsible everything in the government. It has been understood that answer for "who controls the whitehouse of USA", seems " no one knows". This is not a snarky comment, but a statement that workings of the government in USA is very complex, and there are multiple forces in effect at any time, including political parties, supporters, lobbyists, and corporations with interests, and it will be too much to give credit and put focus on a single person.<br><br><br>This book covers lot. It covers Britain, USA, Europe, South America, South Africa, China, Russia, touches upon New-Zealand, India and other nations. The author explores how various leaders in these countries have shaped the political landscapes of these places for better.<br><br></span>

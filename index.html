This was a lengthy book. The interviewers did a fantastic job with their questions and covered a range of expert programmers and language designers across the spectrum. The important thing I gained from reading this book was my "enthusiasm" again for different programming languages and styles. <br>Each different language creator had some "opinions" about the state of affairs and went about in a personal way to do something about it, create a language, create a community, solve the problem, and usually building on top of what the person had learned from others. The language creation is both a scientific process (standing upon the shoulders of giants), as well as the unique taste that each language designer brought to the table. I was excited to learn more about AWK, Haskell, Perl, and Eiffel as languages after reading this book.

The essence of this book is about sympathy. The story is presented through the eyes of a few friends as they witness the plague in the city of Oran. The author, Abert Camus's writing, and the philosophy of the principal character, Dr. Rieux stands out in this Novel. It will probably etch in the mind of the reader forever. It is about sympathy, the qualities of truth, understanding, and comprehension are at the core of it.

<p>It is the year 2021, and I logged into one of my servers using IPv6 address. So far I had struggled with using IPv6
address for anything useful.  Today, I was able login to a server directly from my home using an IPv6 address.</p>
<p>vultr.com provides servers for USD 2.5 per month, with a <em>restriction</em> that it will only have IPv6 address.
But if you can ssh to it, why not get those cheap boxes?</p>

<p>I setup <a class="reference external" href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@Home</a> and started contributing computing resources to <a class="reference external" href="https://foldingathome.org/covid19/">Covid-19</a> project.</p>
<p>For Covid-19, the <a class="reference external" href="https://foldingathome.org/">Folding@Home</a> project is trying to find out the structure of covid-19 virus as it comes in contact
with human bodies through <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angiotensin-converting_enzyme_2">ACE2 receptor</a>, and how an understanding of this can help build therapeutic antibiotics
or molecules that might disrupt the viral interaction.</p>

<p>Bill Gates followed up with a Live Question and Answer session with TED's Chris
Anderson.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>
<strong>Testing</strong> is the still "key part".  We need a way to find to detect who
has-virus and who does not. This is done using swabs. <em>All of us, will have
to be tested before we resume social interaction.</em>
</li>
<li>He is still very much concerned about developing countries, like India,
Pakistan, and countries in the southern hemisphere, as he perceives, will
have more difficulty than developed countries like the US to get this
through.</li>
<li>
<em>Economic Impact</em> can be reversed, but if a life is lost, it cannot be
brought back.</li>
<li>The idea of building herd-immunity against this virus, in reality,  doesn't
look like a choice. The numbers don't add up.</li>

<a class="reference external" href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/A-coronavirus-AMA">Gates Notes AMA</a></p>
<p>The following question and answers caught my attention in particular.</p>
<div class="admonition admonition-bill-gates-ama-on-covid-19-some-question-and-answers">
<p class="first admonition-title">Bill Gates AMA on Covid-19 - Some question and answers.</p>
<p>Q: <strong>What about the current crisis worries you the most? What gives you the
most hope?</strong></p>
<p>Bill: <em>The current phase has a lot of the cases in rich countries.
With the right actions including the testing and social distancing (which I
call “shut down”) within 2-3 months the rich countries should have avoided high
levels of infection. I worry about all the economic damage but even worse will
be how this</em> <strong>will affect the developing countries</strong> <em>who cannot do the social
distancing the same way as rich countries and whose hospital capacity is much
lower.</em></p>
<p>Q: <strong>I read the</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">Imperial College COVID-19 Response Team report</a>
<strong>as well as</strong> <a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/jeremycyoung/status/1239975682643357696">this explanation in a historical context</a>. <strong>Essentially, it
says that by doing nothing, 4 million Americans die. Through the mitigation
strategy—i.e. social distancing and “flattening the curve”— it says that 1.1-2
million Americans will die. However, it also says that the suppression
strategy, or “shutting everything down for 18 months”—will lead to only a few
thousand people dying.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Do you agree with these numbers, and if so, is there any excuse for not
immediately issuing a shelter in place order for the entire country?</strong></p>
<p>Bill: <strong>Fortunately it appears the parameters used in that model
were too negative.</strong> <em>The experience in China is the most critical data we
have. They did their “shut down” and were able to reduce the number of cases.
They are testing widely so they see rebounds immediately and so far there have
not been a lot. They avoided widespread infection. The Imperial model does not
match this experience. Models are only as good as the assumptions put into
them. People are working on models that match what we are seeing more closely
and they will become a key tool. A group called Institute for Disease Modeling
that I fund is one of the groups working with others on this.</em></p>
<p>Q: <strong>How is the economy likely to recover after all of this
in your opinion?</strong></p>
<p>Bill: <em>Yes eventually. The economic impact of the “shut down” will be
large but if it is done well (including the testing piece which I keep
mentioning) eventually we can open back up.</em></p>
<p>Q: <strong>How is your foundation helping the current pandemic? Are you
donating money, producing products for health workers?</strong></p>
<p>Bill: <em>Our foundation is working with all the groups who make
diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines to make sure the right efforts are
prioritized. We want to make sure all countries get access to these tools. We
donated $100M in February for a variety of things and we will be doing more.
One priority is to make sure that there is enough manufacturing capacity for
therapeutics and vaccines.</em> <strong>We have other efforts like our education group
working to make sure the online resources for students are as helpful as they
can be.</strong></p>
<p>Q: <strong>Is there anything you can do to assist with ventilator production?</strong></p>
<p>Bill: <em>There are a lot of efforts to do this. If we do social
distancing (“shut down”) properly then the surge of cases won’t be as
overwhelming.</em> <strong>Our foundation’s expertise is in diagnostics, therapeutics and
vaccines so we are not involved in the ventilator efforts but it could make a
contribution to have more especially as the disease gets into developing
countries including Africa.</strong></p>
<p>Q: <strong>What do you see as the long-term strategy for fighting this
pandemic and do you feel like it will adequately prepare us for the next?</strong></p>
<p class="last">Bill: <em>I think that after this is under control that Governments and
others will invest heavily in being ready for the next one. This will take
global cooperation particularly to help the developing countries who will be
hurt the most. A good example is the need to test therapeutics wherever the
disease is to help the whole world.</em> <strong>The Virus doesn't respect national
boundaries.</strong></p>

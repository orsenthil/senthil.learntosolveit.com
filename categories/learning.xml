&lt;p&gt;It's like to do something because you don't know how to do it rather than to prove or to show, that you can do it. The problem solving or the learning is for the self. That's the essence of mastery based learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final dialog from the movie "The Karate Kid" might be useful to recollect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Han:&lt;/strong&gt; Just tell me, Xiao Dre, why? Why do you need to go back out there so badly?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dre Parker:&lt;/strong&gt; Because I'm still scared. And no matter what happens, tonight, when I leave, I don't want to be scared anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read a article, titled " &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.pixelpoppers.com/2009/11/awesome-by-proxy-addicted-to-fake.html"&gt;Awesome By Proxy- Addicted to Fake Achievement&lt;/a&gt; " by a person discovered what he was doing wrong when choosing the kind of games he was playing, and he could introspect and choose to change this style.&lt;/p&gt;

We humans are remarkably adept at finding ways to lie to ourselves, and ways to be self-destructive.

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this short TED talk video, Salman Khan pitches for mastery based learning. It means that if there is a bar (say
100%) for mastery, then the variable in the learning should be how many hours one spends to attain that bar. Until the
bar of 100% mastery is attained, the student should not be considered the master of the subject, and should not just
move on the next class/course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We adopted the current system because it was impractical for mastery based learning previously, but given our
computational resources, mastery based learning is very much practical today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>learning</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/mastery-based-learning.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 03 Dec 2016 02:55:40 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book might be a quick, due to
glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/26/book-review-the-linux-command-line.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2017 15:29:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Neuromancer</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/888628.Neuromancer" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2225014421"&gt;2 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 15:33:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: 2BR02B</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-2br02b.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11183921-2br02b" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/863064457"&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book belongs to the genre of Space-opera. Plenty of drama, plot twists, hero, heroine and plot twist. I think, I read it twice, and I enjoyed the book when I read it the second time.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/10/book-review-the-stars-like-dust.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 13:17:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Superhuman by Habit</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412054737m/23206969.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit"&gt;Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2608008.Tynan"&gt;Tynan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2202420264"&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The value of this book will be measured by how much I could utilize the tips giving in this book to improve my self-discipline. I will never give a 5-rating for a self-improvement book. The 4 rating is for excellent language and conversational style of this book. The book is well written, it is based on good research, solid principles and explained it's propositions well. Towards the end, it had some "selling" of stuff that author personally liked. But that's it, nothing negative about it.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 07:23:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Indian Astronomy - A Primer</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/26/book-review-indian-astronomy-a-primer.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36098268-indian-astronomy---a-primer" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Indian Astronomy - A Primer" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503333685m/36098268.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36098268-indian-astronomy---a-primer"&gt;Indian Astronomy - A Primer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17116356.Dr_S_Balachandra_Rao"&gt;Dr. S.

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2196009327"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I read this book after I had completed reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1212151.The_Greatest_Inventions_of_the_Past_2_000_Years" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Greatest Inventions of the Past 2,000 Years&lt;/a&gt;. In that, I noted down the contributions of &lt;a href="http://xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/26/the-indo-arabic-number-system.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Indo-Arabic Number System&lt;/a&gt; as one of the significant inventions in the past 2000 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The important thing to note was, the positional value number system along with 0 was invented a 1000 years before the birth of Christ and it was systematized by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#Place_value_system_and_zero" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aryabhatta&lt;/a&gt; in the year 499 CE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This greatly increased my curiosity for Indian mathematics. The book was a boon in that regard. It dwells with the Indian Astronomy, mathematics with a verifiable accuracy. We are given a survey of Astronomy in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas" rel="nofollow"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_astrology" rel="nofollow"&gt; Vedanga Jyotisa &lt;/a&gt;, Siddhantha (established truth), and giving the information about Aryabhatta I, Bhaskaracharya. It goes into details about Zodiacs and constellations (as calculated by the astronomers), Yuga System and Eras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to know that Kali Yuga commenced on 17/18 February 3102 BCE, at the demise of Krishna. &lt;br&gt;So, as of this writing of the review, we have been living in **5119 years** since the start of Kali Yuga (an epoch).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book also introduced me to the concept of Luni-solar months, were lunar months are pegged upon to solar months. The metric value is called Ahargana,. In Sanskrit 'ahoratra' means one full day and 'gana' means count. Hence, the Ahargana on any given day stands for the number of lunar days that have elapsed starting from an epoch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the counting system used in Indian calendars. After giving details about this, book then talks about Co-ordinate systems, Rasi and Naksatra systems, Panchanga (Panchaga means 5 parts which are Tithi, Naksatra, Vara, Yoga and Karana) and gives the reference for the calculation mean positions of Sun, Moon and Planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the words like "Panchanga", "Tithi" etc, one would expect this book to be written by some astrologer or might have some preachiness to it. This is where, I think, the book shines. No, it has none of the preachiness, it has none of the emotional or venerable expressions towards those concepts. Instead, those are presented as Indian mathematics, by done mathematicians in India when as they pursued their understanding of the universe and recorded them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is written by &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/EMIS/mirror/IMU/Elections_2002/ICHM/raocv.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. S. Balachandra Rao&lt;/a&gt; is was a professor of Mathematics, who has published around 20 books in subjects ranging from Numerical methods, differential equations, calculus, Indian Astronomy, and mathematics.

I found this book fascinating. It provided me a window to glimpse at the history of humankind's inventions,
inventors, and discoverers. The aspect that I liked the most was to do with things that I didn't know about
or with the aspects that I had overlooked in the inventions. &lt;br&gt;For e.g. Invention of Rudder played a major
role in navigation, the invention of multiple other devices, funding from the king that helped made Columbus's
journey possible. Modern printing press's invention was for printing Bible. English first came to the US to occupy
the lands in the Longitude 77, that had significance in John Dee's calendar. The Hindu Arabic numeral system
that contributed greatly to the numerous advances in the western world and thinking. Drawing the connections
between the inventions and context of these inventions were equally captivating as the invention itself.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/24/book-review-the-greatest-inventions-of-the-past-2000-years.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 25 Nov 2017 02:06:15 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Three Men in a Boat</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/10/26/three-men-in-a-boat.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4921.Three_Men_in_a_Boat" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Three Men in a Boat (Three Men, #1)" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392791656m/4921.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4921.Three_Men_in_a_Boat"&gt;Three Men in a Boat&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3352.Jerome_K_Jerome"&gt;Jerome K.

Funny writing. Made me chuckle at times and was very imaginative. makes for a light hearted reading.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started reading this book using a hardcopy that I had for long time. For convenience, I quickly finished by reading the online ebook at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/308/308-h/308-h.htm"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; . Since I read fast, I did't enjoy this very much.

The Good Doctor once again explains Cosmology in lucid terms. He starts off with simple premises, known facts, composes and slowly leads up to higher concepts, ultimately leading to the concept of "Black Hole". The book had a "trill" factor to it, as we discover the nature of black holes and what constitutes a black hole and how the universe might have formed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was "wow"ed by this book.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some exciting learning here with this book. I learnt about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

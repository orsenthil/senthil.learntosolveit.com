My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

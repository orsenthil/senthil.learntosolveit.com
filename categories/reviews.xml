My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2482522880"&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I loved this book. This is a very short book, to the point, and explains the universe in simple terms. What I didn't expect and was a surprise to me was the Author's humorous anecdotes, completely relevant to the present day reader inserted between the concepts in the pages.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For e.g. It was funny to know that behind US Govt which consumes Helium for military and research, the next second highest consumer of "Helium" was Macy's for it's Macy's day parade.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was startling to know that life as we understand in any form, the single-celled organism has started in existence only the last 2% of the history of the universe. The universe is very very old, very very big. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Often there is a question on "Is there life elsewhere in the universe?" - The more I read these kinds of books, the more I realize that "There is life elsewhere in the universe. Highly likely. It is inevitable that either Earthians discover the other life forms, and they discover the Earthians. Also, the timeline of advancement, the calamities that are possible in next thousand years, humankind will, of course, take the ship, explore, and start settling in various other parts of the universe. Thinking like this doesn't sound like fiction to me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was a great book. I will start looking out for Neil DeGrasse Tyson from now.&lt;p&gt;Here are some excerpts that I noted from the book. This one is about Einstein, and the kind of impact he had in our
understanding of the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this one is about Spherical shape for any object that we may encounter in the universe.&lt;/p&gt;

A simple overview of Mesos. It enlists the commands and scripts that will be useful to operate a Mesos cluster. Gives an overview of Hadoop and Spark data frameworks and how they can launched on Mesos. It is aimed at operators and system engineers trying to operate Mesos.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2018</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/09/book-review-apache-mesos-essentials.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jan 2018 05:29:11 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review:  Lauren Ipsum: A Story about Computer Science and Other Improbable Things</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/07/book-review-lauren-ipsum-a-story-about-computer-science-and-other-improbable-things.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21929386-lauren-ipsum" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Lauren Ipsum: A Story about Computer Science and Other Improbable Things" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1418764566m/21929386.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21929386-lauren-ipsum"&gt;Lauren Ipsum: A Story about Computer Science and Other Improbable Things&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4982238.Carlos_Bueno"&gt;Carlos Bueno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2248523959"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Learnt some valuable computer science concepts too
since this was taught to a child, it was very easy to grasp. The concepts share are
foundational and it is presented in a neat, easy to understand manner. I internalized the
importance of "naming", the thing with jargons and principle of 5-whys. Very helpful book.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2018</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/01/07/book-review-lauren-ipsum-a-story-about-computer-science-and-other-improbable-things.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 08 Jan 2018 03:00:43 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: The Linux Command Line</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/26/book-review-the-linux-command-line.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11724436-the-linux-command-line" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

For most purposes, I think this could be considered a reference book. Giving quick tips about the
Linux/GNU utility and tools. Even as an experienced user, I managed to find useful tips in this book
about Bash Shell, quoting and testing conditionals in Bash. I appreciated the general notes about
the "Linux culture" sprinkled throughout the text. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This book might be a quick, due to
glancing and turning of pages, and worthy read beginner and experienced programmers alike.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/26/book-review-the-linux-command-line.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 26 Dec 2017 15:29:16 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Neuromancer</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/888628.Neuromancer" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 15:33:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: 2BR02B</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-2br02b.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11183921-2br02b" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

This book belongs to the genre of Space-opera. Plenty of drama, plot twists, hero, heroine and plot twist. I think, I read it twice, and I enjoyed the book when I read it the second time.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/10/book-review-the-stars-like-dust.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 13:17:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Superhuman by Habit</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412054737m/23206969.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit"&gt;Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2608008.Tynan"&gt;Tynan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The value of this book will be measured by how much I could utilize the tips giving in this book to improve my self-discipline. I will never give a 5-rating for a self-improvement book. The 4 rating is for excellent language and conversational style of this book. The book is well written, it is based on good research, solid principles and explained it's propositions well. Towards the end, it had some "selling" of stuff that author personally liked. But that's it, nothing negative about it.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books-read-in-2017</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 07:23:59 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

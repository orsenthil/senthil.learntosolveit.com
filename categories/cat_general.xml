&lt;h5&gt;Greatest In History&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;CHOICE OF MR. H. G. WELLS CHRIST, BUDDHA, AND ARISTOTLE&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;h6&gt;Mr. H. G. Wells names Jesus of Nazareth, Buddha, and Aristotle as having had greater effect on world history than any other known figures.&lt;/h6&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who are the three greatest men in history?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;SOME 13 years ago I was asked to name the six greatest men in the world, says,  Mr. Wells in the "Readers' Digest." I did so. Lately. I have been confronted with my former answer and asked if I still adhere to it. Not altogether. Three of my great names stand as they stood then-but three, I must add it, seem to have lost emphasis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact is that there are not six greatest names to cite.There are only; three.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;When I was asked which single individual has left the most permanent immpression on the world, the manner of the questioner almost carried the implication that it was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus"&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/a&gt;. I agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;He is, I think, a quite cardinal figure in human history, and it will be long before Western men decide-if ever they do decide, to abandon his life as the turning point in their reckoning of time. I am speaking of him, of course, as a man. The historian must treat him as a man, just as the painter must paint him as a man. We do not know as much about him as we would like to know; but the four gospels, though sometimes contradictory, agree in giving us a picture of a very definite personality; they carry a conviction of reality. To assume that he never lived, that the accounts of his life are inventions, is more difficult and raises far more problems for the historian than to accept the essential elements of the gospel stories as fact.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Of course, the reader and I live in countries where to millions of persons believe Jesus is more than a man. But the historian must disregard that fact. He must adhere to the evidence that would pass unchallenged if his book were to be read in every nation under the sun. Now, it is interesting and significant that a historian, without any theological bias whatever, should find that he cannot portray the progress of humanity honestly without giving a foremost place to a peniless teacher from Nazareth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;The old Roman historians ignored Jesus entirely; they left no impress on the

historical records of his time. Yet, more than 1900 years later, a historian like myself, who does not even call himself a Christian, finds the picture centering irresistibly around the life and character of this most significant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;It is one of the most revolutionary changes of outlook that has ever stirred and changed human thought. No age has even yet understood fully the tremendous challenge it carries to the established institutions and subjugations of mankind. But the world began to be a different world from the day that doctrine was preached, and every step toward wider understanding and tolerance and good will is a step in the direction of that universal brotherhood Christ proclaimed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;The historian's test of an Individual's greatness is: "What did he leave to grow? Did he start men to thinking along fresh lines with a vigour that persisted after him?" By this test Jesus stands first. As with Jesus, so with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gautama_Buddha"&gt;Buddha&lt;/a&gt;, whom I would put very near in importance to Christ. You see clearly a man, simple, devout, lonely, battling for light, a vivid human personality, not a myth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;He, too. gave a message to mankind universal in its character. Many of our best modern ideas are in closest harmony with it. All the miseries and discontents of life are due, he taught, to selfishness. Selfishness takes three forms-one, the desire to satisfy the senses; another, the craving for immortality; and the third is the desire for prosperity, worldliness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Before a man can become serene he must cease to live for his senses or himself. Then he merges into a greater being. Buddha in different language called men to self-forgetfulness 500 years before Christ. In some ways he was nearer to us and our needs. He was more lucid upon our individual importance in service than Christ and less ambiguous upon the question of personal immortality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Aristotle Next. &lt;span style="line-height:1.7em;"&gt;I would write the name of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style="line-height:1.7em;" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle"&gt;Aristotle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style="line-height:1.7em;"&gt;, who is as cardinal in the story of the human intelligence as Christ and Buddha in the story of the human will. Aristotle began a great new thing in the world--the classifying and analysing of information. He was the father of the scientific synthesis. There had been thinkers in the world before, but he taught men to think together. He was the tutor of Alexander the Great, whose support made it possible for him to organise study on a scale and in a manner never before attempted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;At one time he had a thousand men, scattered throughout Asia and Greece, collecting material for his natural history. Political as well as natural science began with him. His students made an analysis of 153 political constitutions. Aristotle's Insistence on facts and their rigid analysis, the determination to look the truth in the face, was a vast new step in human progress.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;These are three great names. I could write down 20 or 30 names. For the next three places. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato"&gt;Plato&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"&gt;Mohammed&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confucius"&gt;Confucius&lt;/a&gt;? I turn over names like Robert Owen, tie real founder of modrern Socialism. I can even weigh my pet aversion, Karl Marx, for a place. He made the world think of economic realities, even If he made it think a little askew.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Then what of those great astronomers who broke the crystal globe in whic man's imagination had been confined and let it out into limitless space. &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Bacon"&gt;Bacon&lt;/a&gt;'s Predictions then in that original selection of mine. I find that my own particular weakness for Roger Bacon crept in. He voiced a passionate insistence upon the need for experiment and of collecting knowledge. He predicted more than six hundred years ago, the advent of ships and trains that could be mechanically propelled; he also prophesied flying machines. He, too, set men thinking along new, fresh lines, and left an influence that has lived for the benefit of all generations. But when I come to put him beside Christ, Buddha, and Aristotle-it won't do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;Do you want an American in the list? &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"&gt;Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, better than any other, seemed to me to embody the essential characteristics of America. He stood for equality of opportunity, for the right and the chance of the child of the humblest home to reach the higest place. His simplicity, his humour, his patience, his deep-abiding optimism, based on the conviction that right would prevail-all these seemed to typify the best that America had to give mankind. Put, against those three who are enduring symbols of brotherhood and individual divinity, of service in self forgetfulness, and of the intellectual synthesis of mankind, what was rugged Abraham Lincoln?  Do you really want an American in the list yet? America is still young.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;I think I will leave it at three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:justify;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Herbert George Wells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.xtoinfinity.com/2014/06/img_20140518_182312330_hdr.jpg"&gt;&lt;img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1431" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_20140518_182312330_hdr.jpg?w=300" alt="IMG_20140518_182312330_HDR" width="300" height="168"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We went to Maker Faire in the bay area as a group outing and had a wonderful time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the trip report by children who had been to Maker Faire for the first time. I hope this interests and inspires other families and children to attend Maker Faire next year and have a good time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;By Praharshitha&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;address&gt;Elementary School Student, Grade 5&lt;/address&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Maker Faire was cool. It had all kinds of stuff. In the first building, I liked a few things: Hay hacker (3-D printer flash light making) and making an animal cell with modeling clay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hay hackers group:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; It had a robot dog that barks, jumps and sticks it head out. There was also a scrarecrow that waved its hand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image01.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1426 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image01.png?w=297" alt="image01" width="297" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Front portion of flashlight:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Flash-light with 3-D printer:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;  &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;In the hay-hackers, I built a flash light. First you get an LED light and see which metal connector is longer. The longer one is positive. The  shorter one is negative. You take the positive metal connector and bend it upwards. Then you take a button cell (small disc battery) and put the button cell with words facing up on the table. Finally you take the case, put the LED with the negative metal connector facing down and slip in the LED between the two metal connectors. Now you put the lid on and you are done. When you press the lid, the positive metal connector touches the battery and that makes the circuit complete. When the ciruit is closed, the LED lights up. That's how I made the flashlight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image00.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1425 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image00.png?w=184" alt="image00" width="184" height="300"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Backside of the flashlight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;The case and the lid that I used for the flashlight were made from the 3-D printer. At first, when my friend told me there was a 3-D printer in their library, I thought it was like you put in a paper with picture, and when the printer prints it, the object pops out. But it is not like that. The 3-D printer does not use ink. It uses plastic or wax instead. The plastic thread goes to the injecting (printing) tip. The tip melts the plastic and the tip moves in a shape which makes the case and lid. It is not exactly like a regular printer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Cell-model:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Another thing I did was an animal cell model. I made it out of clay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image03.png"&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1428 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image03.png?w=300" alt="The picture of the model cell" width="300" height="190"&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The picture of the model cell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;First I got a round purple ball with holes. That is the nucleolus. Then we cover it with white clay. That is the nucleus. Then we put the centrosome. Then we put the Mitochondrion which gives energy to the cell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1429 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image04.jpg?w=300" alt="Its unimpressive outer look (cell membrane)" width="300" height="225"&gt; Its unimpressive outer look (cell membrane)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;  After we put the Mitochondrion, I put the Vacuole. Vacuoles    are like closets. They store things (eg. Waste products). Finally  I put the rough Endoplasmic Reticulum. It is for transportation  through out the cell. Then for the covering the last part, we  could choose any color for the cell membrane. After one week,  at home, I cut the model cell in two halves and I saw all the  parts that I put in the cell and it very nice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;Another favorite things in the first building was the pinball cart. You could play pinball game inside the cart. There were three machines. They were all fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;On the second building, it was full of light. At 4:30, there was an electric arc show. It was so loud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RadioShack:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1427 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image02.png?w=300" alt="image02" width="300" height="258"&gt; Front side of the blinking badge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;When we got out of the building, we saw the radioshack tent. When I saw the sign that said theme&lt;b&gt; Soldering&lt;/b&gt;, I thought it was about soldiers. It was weird for RadioShack having a Social Studies class. But when I went in, it wasn’t about soldiers. It was about connecting metal parts. In there, I built a blinking circuit board in the form of a badge. First I got all the materials for the badge and got an instructor. The instructor asked to hold the soldering rod with its tip touching the lead wire. There were lead vapors coming out. My dad said not to breathe it in. I had to be careful in handling the iron rod so as not to touch the electric wire connected to it. Because the iron was 700F degrees hot!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class="wp-image-1430 size-medium" src="http://xtoinf.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/image05.png?w=216" alt="image05" width="216" height="300"&gt; Back side of the blinking badge&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;I took the LED and put it in the board. When I was soldering, I melted too much lead which formed a blob. My instructor said to keep blob heated to avoid its hardening. We put a copper wire to absorb the blob but it was difficult. Then we tried sucking up the blob with a device. That worked! Next we soldered the other side and now comes the test to see if our badge is going to work. Last, we slipped in the battery and the LED worked and it was blinking! We were done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p style="text-align:left;"&gt;In the third building, all I saw was plants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Deepak&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;address&gt;Middle School Student, Grade 7&lt;/address&gt;It was a pleasant experience at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;faire&lt;/span&gt;. There were a whole bunch of interesting things at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;faire&lt;/span&gt;. I surely didn’t see all of &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;faire&lt;/span&gt;, but I did like what I saw. The first interesting thing was the Lego build that they had. It was cool that they could make a miniature London at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Faire&lt;/span&gt;. I wonder how much they spent on the build and how long it took them. Speaking of Lego, I also saw the Lego RC car. It was a bit noisy since it was plastic but I would have liked it if it went a little faster. One thing I didn’t like there was the drone fight inside. They should have let kids the ages over 13 to fly the drones, especially me…( I can fly that thing like a charm) I understand that the drones are very expensive but they should have took a chance with  me. This is the one thing I hated. Going back to the things I like, I went over to Nvidia booth. They were showing off their CUDA cores with their 4 Titan graphics cards. CUDA cores let the GPU do both graphic performances and can be used for general use. I also played Project Cars in 4K! The detail was amazing and all of this was powered by those Titans. I got a 8gb thumb drive(flash drive), so that was cool. They had the Nvidia Shield showcased. It is basically a mini gaming console. They were just trying show how good their Tegra processor was. At Intel, there wasn’t much other than some processors. I found a computer with AMD processors installed at the INTEL booth. There was a machine that picked up little stones of the ground and it was powered by Intel and Alienware. I then got to the dragster car at the edge of the &lt;span class="il"&gt;Maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Faire&lt;/span&gt;. They even started the engine and what a roar! I also found a fire breathing machine that was basically the bass for the orchestra that was playing. That was also a another cool thing at &lt;span class="il"&gt;Maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Faire&lt;/span&gt;. These were the most interestings things I saw at the &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;faire&lt;/span&gt;.
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Harini&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;address&gt;Middle School Student (Grade 7)&lt;/address&gt;&lt;address&gt; &lt;/address&gt;&lt;span class="il"&gt;Maker&lt;/span&gt;'s Fair Experience
&lt;p&gt;Since this was my first time going to the &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt;'s fair, I didn't expect to see so many new innovations in technology. I thought it was a great experience because the people worked very hard to create something, and they are very excited for other people to look at their new and creative ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, I noticed that most of the people made inventions relating to robotics, however, there were other types too. For&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;example, when I first entered the building, there was a booth where they made crafts out of tape called tapigami. This was interesting to me because it reminded me of origami which is made out of paper. But this is made out of tape instead. I think that this was a very creative idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing that I liked was the chess playing machine. I had never seen anything like this before. I liked this idea the most because if you don't have anybody to play chess with, then you can play with a machine instead. It also might be more challenging for some people based on their skill level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was also a place where kids made their rockets following the instructions and it was launched into the air.  This was also one of my favorites because how the rocket was made affected the outcome of the launch, and it was fascinating to see different variations of the same type of rocket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had fun exploring the &lt;span class="il"&gt;maker&lt;/span&gt;'s fair and I'm excited to come back again next year to see many more new ideas in technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Senthil&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;In general, this year's &lt;span class="il"&gt;Maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Faire&lt;/span&gt; was awesome as usual. I had a chance meeting with Salman Khan of Khan Academy and I was extremely happy for that. I took a photo with him and shared about some of the sourashtra translation that I had attempted. This made my day already and I felt everything beyond was a bonus.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align:center;"&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"&gt;&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet your hero moment for me at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MakerFaire?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MakerFaire&lt;/a&gt; I talked with Sal about sourashtra language &amp;amp; translation I've attempted &lt;a href="http://t.co/B3FdfRjm9R"&gt;pic.twitter.com/B3FdfRjm9R&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Senthil Kumaran (@phoe6) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/phoe6/status/469143392228605952?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 21, 2014&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;There are two events that captured my attention during this &lt;span class="il"&gt;Maker&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="il"&gt;Faire&lt;/span&gt; which I wanted to note down and preserve it. There was this booth called "Make Rockets Here" , where children and parents were making paper rockets and a gentleman was launching those paper rockets. It was a craft and people were busy creating and flying their paper rockets. I observed the joy of kids as one rocket after the other shot up into the air.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;There was one rocket which which caught my attention, amongst 100s of rockets being made. This one was strikingly good, when the kid took that rocket to the person was launching, he looked at and appreciated, he said there is a "there is good feel to it and this will definitely go very high". This kid's parent had accompanied him and the person looked at him with respect, appreciating the care they had put in creating that paper rocket.  And it turned out that particular the rocket did fly very high. Putting care and attention into stuff, no matter what, really ends up in good results.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;The other project that caught my attention was mechanical chess playing arm. I got curious to know how it works, because it is both a mechnical challenge (The Arm Part) and a computer challenge (playing the chess). I talked with the engineer behind it and he shared that he has a RFID chip on all the chess pieces as well as on the squares on the board and the information from that is transfered to the computer in the arm. That simplifies it a lot. The information that is required to play is available in the form of chess coordinates and the chess playing program can easily interpret the coordinates and return the next move. This move information can then be given the mechnical arm and it can pick the pieces based on the RFID and place it the correct stop. Yeah, picking the pieces was the tricky one and the engineer was very proud that he could accomplish his. If you like playing chess, this chess playing arm can might be a great companion for you at your home.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand that users will be able to see through, but does it also mean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the users won't be affected by the change? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zemblan said: It means they probably wont notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamcas: They probably won't notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;phoe6: that seems true, but I don't get the logic of how something being&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;transparent means this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shamcas: they don't see it. :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViciousPotato: phoe6: If something is transparent, you can see through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ViciousPotato: Thus, a transparent change would be something a user would&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;likely look right past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2010/01/28/change-is-transparent-to-users.html</guid><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2010 20:45:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Python Strings as Comments</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/10/21/python-strings-as-comments.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question was:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Python we can emulate multiline comments using triple-quoted&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;strings, but conceptually strings and comments are very different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I.e. strings are objects, comments are auxillary text discarded at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;compile time. Strings are objects created at runtime, comments are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer from Steven D'Aprano:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Guido's time-machine strikes again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; import dis&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; def test():&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...     x = 1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...     """&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...     This is a triple-quote comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...     """&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...     return x&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; dis.dis(test)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2           0 LOAD_CONST               1 (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;STORE_FAST&lt;/span&gt;               &lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;p&gt;6           6 LOAD_FAST                0 (x)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="code literal-block"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;          &lt;span class="mi"&gt;9&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RETURN_VALUE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;String literals -- not just triple-quoted strings, but any string &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;literal -- that don't go anywhere are discarded by the Python compiler, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;precisely so they can be used as comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/10/21/python-strings-as-comments.html</guid><pubDate>Wed, 21 Oct 2009 13:29:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Pell's Equation</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/10/09/pells-equation.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;x^2 - n y^2 = 1  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The word "algebra" is a shortened misspelled transliteration of an Arabic title al-jebr w'al-muqabalah (circa 825) by the Persian mathematician known as al-Khowarismi. The al-jebr part means "reunion of broken parts", the second part al-muqabalah translates as "to place in front of, to balance, to oppose, to set equal." Together they describe symbol manipulations common in algebra: combining like terms, moving a term to the other side of an equation, etc.http://www.cut-the-knot.org/WhatIs/WhatIsAlgebra.shtml&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>knuth</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/06/19/muhammad-al-khowarizmi.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jun 2009 05:09:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>The pasta theory of design</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/06/16/the-pasta-theory-of-design.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pasta theory of design:&lt;/p&gt;

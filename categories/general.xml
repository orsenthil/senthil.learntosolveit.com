&lt;p&gt;I might have stumbled upon this via hackernews and this topic is of perennial interest to me. The general advice
given were helpful. I liked the specific, measurable suggestions too. These were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn C  - &lt;em&gt;I know C. I have written C. I will need to get back to writing in C.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write a compiler  - &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn macros - &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SICP - &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand continuations - &lt;em&gt;Not yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If anything, just try a new language - &lt;em&gt;I try this every now and then. The emphasis on his post were learning functional languages which, I think, I will be starting this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I collected these important points from the article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A small hint comes from interesting research about how people thrive. In one shocking experiment, researchers found that senior citizens who didn’t feel useful to others were nearly three times as likely to die prematurely as those who did feel useful. This speaks to a broader human truth: We all need to be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being “needed” does not entail selfish pride or unhealthy attachment to the worldly esteem of others. Rather, it consists of a natural human hunger to serve our fellow men and women. As the 13th-century Buddhist sages taught, “If one lights a fire for others, it will also brighten one’s own way.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feeling superfluous is a blow to the human spirit. It leads to social isolation and emotional pain, and creates the conditions for negative emotions to take root.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Indeed, what unites the two of us in friendship and collaboration is not shared politics or the same religion. It is something simpler: a shared belief in compassion, in human dignity, in the intrinsic usefulness of every person to contribute positively for a better and more meaningful world.&lt;/li&gt;

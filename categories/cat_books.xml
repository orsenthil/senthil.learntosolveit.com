My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2225014421"&gt;2 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I couldn't understand this book. It was a hard book to read. I liked the language used by the bartender
like addressing Case as "Artiste" and like the picturesque description of the settings in the book. But I
couldn't understand the plot, I couldn't understand or follow the motivation of the characters. I took help
from the Internet to follow what's the story about, but still I seemed to have missed much of the story in
this book. Given the number of awards this book has won, the experience was little unexpected one for me.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books</category><category>reviews</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-neuromancer.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 25 Dec 2017 15:33:03 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: 2BR02B</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/25/book-review-2br02b.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11183921-2br02b" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2843859.Kazuhiro_Fujitaki"&gt;Kazuhiro Fujitaki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

&lt;p&gt;30 years of K&amp;amp;R is being celebrated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important book our life time and Inform IT has an article on "&lt;a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138913"&gt;Leading Programmers Remember the Impact of The C Programming Language&lt;/a&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roughly around &lt;a href="http://sarovar.org/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/CVSROOT/?cvsroot=uthcode"&gt;10 years ago&lt;/a&gt; to get myself into Software Development, I &lt;a href="http://www.uthcode.com/cprogramming.html"&gt;started solving all the problems&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the K&amp;amp;R book and bootstrapped my Project &lt;a href="http://www.uthcode.com"&gt;Uthcode&lt;/a&gt; for the third time.  I can safely say that it turned out be successful and I owe greatly to this one book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later when I started &lt;a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/python/contributors/111669178856"&gt;contributing to Python&lt;/a&gt;, I focussed mostly on Python and standard library which is written in Python.  Noticing how other programmers went about with CPython core, I wanted to re-read it to get into K&amp;amp;R get into implementation and design. That has not happened yet, but I am planning for it sometime soonish. I can get back and rely on K&amp;amp;R, plus I will have my experience to draw upon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>Aside</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2013/06/16/30-years-of-kr-is-being-celebrated-this-is.html</guid><pubDate>Mon, 17 Jun 2013 06:09:57 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review - The Startup of You</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2013/03/10/book-review-the-startup-of-you.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12701065-the-start-up-of-you" style="float:left;padding-right:20px;"&gt;&lt;img alt="The Start-up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform Your Career" border="0" src="http://d.gr-assets.com/books/1333576892m/12701065.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12701065-the-start-up-of-you"&gt;The Start-up of You: Adapt to the Future, Invest in Yourself, and Transform Your Career&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5039437.Reid_Hoffman"&gt;Reid Hoffman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My rating: &lt;a href="http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/520924798"&gt;4 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This book is from the CEO / Co-Founder of a Web 2.0 company, LinkedIn and goes a great detail into the culture and professional aspects of similar companies that existing in silicon valley. Reid Hoffman gives the examples of many startup founders and sets the stage for how and why started their respective ventures. The stories which I did not know earlier and which caught my attention were the stories of Netflix and Zappos. Both were amazing. The best part the book in my opinion is the many examples that Reid and Ben provide as examples to support the point they were trying to say.&lt;br&gt;I also liked the chapters in which the authors give sufficient focus on the failed auto industry business in US and what the computer industry and the leaders of computer industry can learn from that episode. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Most part of the book is no-frills, bare minimum good practical advise which many should follow and I believe, it is obvious to everyone. But reinforcing and giving concrete shape to those abstract ideas still helps and this book does a great job at it.   Since I am enthusiastic about startup and their stories, I found this book easy to read, it caught my attention quickly and I could finish it without any lag. The final list of the reference books many a good one to follow up and keep the interest in the subject going. This book is about Internet business and your career when the Internet is always ON. I would say it should be categorized under "popular-business" similar to "popular-science" genre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

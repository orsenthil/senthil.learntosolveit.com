My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224419627"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This book can be read in the time you'd read the wikipedia page about this book. This was the first
Kurt Vonnegut book for me, and it was a sampler for what to expect if I read more from the author.
It's a concise presentation of dystopian future when humanity has decided on population control in a
weird way. I was thinking that there is logical loop hole in the book, I can't say that as it would be
a spoiler, however, I think, author intended the reader to focus on the bigger picture than question
some of the assumptions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book might help you to appreciate the mess in this world!

by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2843859.Kazuhiro_Fujitaki"&gt;Kazuhiro Fujitaki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

My rating: &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2224962360"&gt;5 of 5 stars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This is a very high quality book that explains the concept of electricity to the reader. My personal story is I
had started ignoring the electricity terms as something confusing, to be taken for granted and "someone-else"
will know better. So the labels in the electronic appliances, my houses energy consumption, electric appliance
voltages like 120 V and 240 V etc, were household terms, but no intuitive meaning for them. This book changed
that for me. I can understand what those terms mean now. I look at the batteries and have sense of how this is
working. I am looking forward to my Solar setup to understand the energy usage. I appreciate how the Integrated
Circuits work with the underlying concept of diodes, flow of electricity, concepts of physics and chemistry
involved in what makes or creates electricity in the first place. This book opened up a universe for me.

This book belongs to the genre of Space-opera. Plenty of drama, plot twists, hero, heroine and plot twist. I think, I read it twice, and I enjoyed the book when I read it the second time.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/10/book-review-the-stars-like-dust.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 10 Dec 2017 13:17:55 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Superhuman by Habit</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412054737m/23206969.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23206969-superhuman-by-habit"&gt;Superhuman by Habit: A Guide to Becoming the Best Possible Version of Yourself, One Tiny Habit at a Time&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2608008.Tynan"&gt;Tynan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The value of this book will be measured by how much I could utilize the tips giving in this book to improve my self-discipline. I will never give a 5-rating for a self-improvement book. The 4 rating is for excellent language and conversational style of this book. The book is well written, it is based on good research, solid principles and explained it's propositions well. Towards the end, it had some "selling" of stuff that author personally liked. But that's it, nothing negative about it.&lt;/span&gt;</description><category>books</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/12/02/book-review-superhuman-by-habit.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Dec 2017 07:23:59 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Book Review: Indian Astronomy - A Primer</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/26/book-review-indian-astronomy-a-primer.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36098268-indian-astronomy---a-primer" style="float: left; padding-right: 20px"&gt;&lt;img border="0" alt="Indian Astronomy - A Primer" src="https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1503333685m/36098268.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36098268-indian-astronomy---a-primer"&gt;Indian Astronomy - A Primer&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17116356.Dr_S_Balachandra_Rao"&gt;Dr. S.

I read this book after I had completed reading the book &lt;a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1212151.The_Greatest_Inventions_of_the_Past_2_000_Years" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Greatest Inventions of the Past 2,000 Years&lt;/a&gt;. In that, I noted down the contributions of &lt;a href="http://xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/26/the-indo-arabic-number-system.html" rel="nofollow"&gt;The Indo-Arabic Number System&lt;/a&gt; as one of the significant inventions in the past 2000 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The important thing to note was, the positional value number system along with 0 was invented a 1000 years before the birth of Christ and it was systematized by &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aryabhata#Place_value_system_and_zero" rel="nofollow"&gt;Aryabhatta&lt;/a&gt; in the year 499 CE.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This greatly increased my curiosity for Indian mathematics. The book was a boon in that regard. It dwells with the Indian Astronomy, mathematics with a verifiable accuracy. We are given a survey of Astronomy in &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas" rel="nofollow"&gt;, &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_astrology" rel="nofollow"&gt; Vedanga Jyotisa &lt;/a&gt;, Siddhantha (established truth), and giving the information about Aryabhatta I, Bhaskaracharya. It goes into details about Zodiacs and constellations (as calculated by the astronomers), Yuga System and Eras.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I came to know that Kali Yuga commenced on 17/18 February 3102 BCE, at the demise of Krishna. &lt;br&gt;So, as of this writing of the review, we have been living in **5119 years** since the start of Kali Yuga (an epoch).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book also introduced me to the concept of Luni-solar months, were lunar months are pegged upon to solar months. The metric value is called Ahargana,. In Sanskrit 'ahoratra' means one full day and 'gana' means count. Hence, the Ahargana on any given day stands for the number of lunar days that have elapsed starting from an epoch. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the counting system used in Indian calendars. After giving details about this, book then talks about Co-ordinate systems, Rasi and Naksatra systems, Panchanga (Panchaga means 5 parts which are Tithi, Naksatra, Vara, Yoga and Karana) and gives the reference for the calculation mean positions of Sun, Moon and Planets. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Given the words like "Panchanga", "Tithi" etc, one would expect this book to be written by some astrologer or might have some preachiness to it. This is where, I think, the book shines. No, it has none of the preachiness, it has none of the emotional or venerable expressions towards those concepts. Instead, those are presented as Indian mathematics, by done mathematicians in India when as they pursued their understanding of the universe and recorded them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The book is written by &lt;a href="ftp://ftp.gwdg.de/pub/EMIS/mirror/IMU/Elections_2002/ICHM/raocv.pdf" rel="nofollow"&gt;Dr. S. Balachandra Rao&lt;/a&gt; is was a professor of Mathematics, who has published around 20 books in subjects ranging from Numerical methods, differential equations, calculus, Indian Astronomy, and mathematics.

&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/11/24/book-review-the-greatest-inventions-of-the-past-2000-years.html"&gt;Book Review: The Greatest Inventions of the Past 2000 Years&lt;/a&gt; book that I wanted to note down in my blog for
future reference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I wanted to note down is, I personally find that numeric system that we use today has stood the test of time
and is limitless. And my second reason could be due to a emotional attachment and association that is imbibed in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;V. S. Ramachandran&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
My favorite invention is the place-value notation system combined with the the user of a symbol 0 for zero to
denote a nonexistant number; this marks the birth of modern mathematics. This system was invented in India, probably
during the first millennium before Christ, but was first systematized by the Hindu mathematician and astronomer
Aryabhata I at the tail end of the  fifth century and then transmitted to the West via the Arabs (hence the phrase
"Arabic Numerals"). Before this time, even simple arithmetic was tedious and time-consuming (as when the Romans and
Greeks used the cumbersome "Roman numerals" - sometime still used in the west). And math, of course, is essential
for all science. Without the early invention of zero and place value as well as the use of the a symbol to denote
an unknown quantity in an equation (algebra), also from India, subsequent developments could not have occurred.
There would be no calculus, no newtonian or Galilean science, no computers, and essentially no modern world.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keith Devlin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What is the most important invention in the past two thousand years?" is one of those questions that
no correct answer - like "What is the best novel / symphony / movie?" - But if I had to make a choice,
it would be the Hindu-Arabic number system, which reached essentially it's present form in the sixth
century. Without it, Galileo would have been unable to begin the quantificational study of nature which we
now call science, and we would not have had calculus, another major invention of the period in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before of it's linguistic structure, the Hindu-Arabic number system allows humans who have an innate linguistic
fluency but only a very primitive number sense to use their ability with language to handle numbers of virtually
any useful magnitude, with as much precision as required. Today there is scarcely any aspect of life that
does not depend on our ability to handle numbers efficiently and accurately. True, we now use computers to
do much of our number crunching, but without the Hindu-Arabic number system we would not have any computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to it's use in arithmetic and science, the Hindu-Arabic number system is the only genuinely
universal language on earth - apart, perhaps, from the Windows Operating System, which has achieved
the near universal adoption of a conceptually and technologically poor product by the sheer force
of market dominance. By contrast, the Hindu-Arabic number system gained worldwide acceptance because
it is far better designed and much more efficient for human usage than any other number system.&lt;/p&gt;

Funny writing. Made me chuckle at times and was very imaginative. makes for a light hearted reading.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started reading this book using a hardcopy that I had for long time. For convenience, I quickly finished by reading the online ebook at &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/308/308-h/308-h.htm"&gt;Project Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt; .

The Good Doctor once again explains Cosmology in lucid terms. He starts off with simple premises, known facts, composes and slowly leads up to higher concepts, ultimately leading to the concept of "Black Hole". The book had a "trill" factor to it, as we discover the nature of black holes and what constitutes a black hole and how the universe might have formed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was "wow"ed by this book.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some exciting learning here with this book. I learnt about the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a short non-technical book consisting of compiled speeches of Richard Feynman. It does not into physics, but
covers a lot of topics like religion, politics, society, ethical questions in science, atom bombs and scientist
motivations. Richard feynman has lot of context to explore all these areas. Plus, his communication style is very
pleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I usually avoid reading general books like this. But I happen to pick this up, and on a day, when I was about to give
some leeway into an astrology (it's not a science) shared by my close ones, having just reading a topic in this book
gave me excellent points to bring my thinking back into track. Contrary to my assumption when starting to read this

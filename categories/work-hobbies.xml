Even if the area is one of your expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had to think about this, as I am undertaking (as a student) a &lt;a href="https://class.coursera.org/interactivepython-003/"&gt;intermediate python course&lt;/a&gt; online along with my friend Avinash.  Since I know the concepts well, I usually do not listen to the lectures and jump directly to exercises and quizzes. We have to a mini-project every week and I plan just enough time to complete the project.  It is not just time, but I think, I &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;plan for just enough motivation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; to complete the project by deadline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Pong game project, I had scored 2 points less than others peers, for whom I had given full credit. If I think, why should I score less in peer evaluation, it occurs to me that I am not patient enough with the project and I am not patient to complete it fully to everyone's satisfaction even though I might be fully capable of doing so. Quite a realization. It will be good if I do something about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>work hobbies</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2013/11/15/on-the-topic-of-good-work.html</guid><pubDate>Fri, 15 Nov 2013 13:01:44 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

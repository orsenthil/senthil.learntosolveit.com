I missed the signal and I realized only when people crossing the road that I had missed it. Got caught by the police and with the routine checks, I noticed that I did not have emission certificate with me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My bad, 2 offenses. 1) Not stopping at Signal and 2) Not having emission certificate for my vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the Police guy wanted to add another offense as 3) dangerous driving. When pleaded and argued that I was not driving dangerous, he just reminded that it is his decision to inform that was I dangerous driving or not and wanted to put fine as Rs.800/- with dangerous driving fine as Rs.500/-. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With lot of requests and conversations and he pulled in two of his friends and to settle the matter, was happy if I pay him Rs.300/-. I did not think much, thought it was okay, just giving him money for his himself and house, rather than lasting it further and gave Rs.300/- as bribe and came back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today morning as I recollect it, I think I did wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Have my papers ready and be ready to pay the fine would have been more appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Unnecessary talking could have been avoided.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the instance when wrongly charged all I wanted to was escape and Rs.300/- for that escape was bit costly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previously, near the Indiranagar to Koramangala flyover, when the cop caught me, I had emission certificate but not insurance. So just checked the emission certificate and for the lack of insurance instead of fining Rs.300/-, he just gave Rs.100/- back and pocketed Rs.200/-. I did not say anything then either, thought Rs.100/- saved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>mistakes</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2009/02/07/paid-300-as-bribe-to-a-policewala.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 07 Feb 2009 18:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

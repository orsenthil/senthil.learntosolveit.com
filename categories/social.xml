garner more respect than people who people argue, however logical, in social situations.&lt;/p&gt;</description><category>social</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/06/23/self-control.html</guid><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jun 2018 05:44:33 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Want to save a family from deadly mosquitoes?</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2017/08/15/want-to-save-a-family-from-deadly-mosquitoes.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates just gave a bed net to a family in need on my behalf.

Stumbled upon this website called
webofstories.com that feature many scientists and carries &lt;em&gt;extensive&lt;/em&gt; interviews with them, who reflect upon their
life, their personal moments, their personal views on their achievements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I watched the entire &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.webofstories.com/play/donald.knuth/1"&gt;3 hour interview with Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt; and immensely enjoyed it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the excellent moment was, when he shares his 2nd computer program, which was a learning tic-tac-toe. This was
written for the IBM 650 Machine having just 10K bytes of memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/650-2.jpg" class="align-center" src="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/computinghistory/650-2.jpg" style="width: 450px; height: 300px;"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those days, the programs were written in punched-cards and a typical program would look something like this (location,
instruction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
0001 0000010000
0002 0000000000-
0003 1000018003
0004 6100080007
0005 2400008003
0006 0100008000
0007 6900060005
0008 2019990003
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine writing an AI program in that. The difficulty of writing does not matter, just the possibility that it could be
written and could be very was exciting, probably led Knuth to write it. This video shows his excitement when he shares
that moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="youtube-video align-center"&gt;
&lt;iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_c3dKYrjj2Q?rel=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other interview bits are interesting too. Knuth covers academia, maths, computer science, computer history, programming
as art, typography, religion, his dates, his wife, his children and awards he has won. Many interesting things can be
picked up.&lt;/p&gt;

"If it doesn't go well, so what, I tried, and I did it." - Donald Knuth on his thoughts, when delivering the lecture of "Science and Religion" at MIT.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The topic of
punishments is a complex one and needs balanced thinking. The author elucidated many reasons for which punishments are
administered in society. We see the trends of those in both online and offline societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Punishments are administered for one of the following reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incapacitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is stopping somebody from doing an unacceptable behavior in the society again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Restitution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is getting something back for the victim of somebody who misbehaves, to compensate them for that which they've been
deprived by the offender. Like charging fine and using it for taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retribution&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is like feeling of justice that deprived might get. Many of us think, this is the primary purpose for punishment. This
is non measurable, but often paves way to other measurable impacts like incapacitation, restitution etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rehabilitation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose is to give the offender, time to reflect on the wrong doing, possibly empathize with the one affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class="simple"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deterrence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is about reducing the likelihood that misbehaviour will occur in the first place. The punishment is more for a warning
to prevent a socially unacceptable behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many a social regulatory policies can be mapped to above concepts of negative reinforcements to prevent any undesirable
outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>meta</category><category>social</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/rationale-behind-punishments.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 27 Dec 2016 15:32:32 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

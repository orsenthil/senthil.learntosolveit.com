I was struggling to find an intuitive explanation, and two answers helped me to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
For each element, you have two choices: either you put it in your subset, or you don't; and these choices are all
independent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bruno Joyal (&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12507/bruno-joyal"&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/users/12507/bruno-joyal&lt;/a&gt;), What is the proof that the total number of
subsets of a set is $2^n$?, URL (version: 2013-10-31): &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417"&gt;https://math.stackexchange.com/q/546417&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another was this table that represented the sets as binary, to denote 0 as an absence of the element and 1 as presence
of the element.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That can help us understand that the total number of subsets of set of n is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(2^n\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>maths</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/what-is-the-proof-that-total-number-of-subsets-of-a-set-is-2n.html</guid><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jan 2019 13:18:44 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title>Radians and Roger Coats</title><link>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/02/17/radians-and-roger-coats.html</link><dc:creator>Senthil Kumaran</dc:creator><description>&lt;div&gt;&lt;p&gt;When trying to understand the concept of &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian#History"&gt;radians&lt;/a&gt;, I came across the inventor of the concept &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Cotes"&gt;Roger Coats&lt;/a&gt;
His name is not familiar to many. I understood, he is known for working closely with Isaac Newton by proofreading the
second edition of his famous book, the Principia, before publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cotes died from a violent fever in Cambridge in 1716 at the early age of 33. Isaac Newton remarked, "If he had lived we would have known something."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description><category>maths</category><guid>http://www.xtoinfinity.com/posts/2018/02/17/radians-and-roger-coats.html</guid><pubDate>Sat, 17 Feb 2018 21:23:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>

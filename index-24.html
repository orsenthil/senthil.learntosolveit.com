<p>A very exciting thing happened this week.</p>
<p><strong>Elon Musk laid out a plan for human beings like us to travel to mars and start a civilization there.</strong></p>
<p>This is a multi-year plan, and there will be multiple rockets carrying humans and cargo. It seems it will take 3 months
to reach to the destination and it has be done with Earth and Mars are in sync, which happens every 28 months.</p>
<p>Elon Musk's SpaceX team is trying to reduce the cost to a affordable level of 200K USD per ticket. If the ticket
happens to be more than 5x this, it will still be worth it.</p>
<p>The design of the rocket, the system architecture and the entire plan was really impressive. Here is the link to
the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.spacex.com/sites/spacex/files/mars_presentation.pdf">presentation</a> that Elon Musk gave.</p>
<p>If you are truly interested, this whole video for 1 hour gives a good overview.</p>

<p>We got the Netflix subscription recently and one of the movies I watched after getting Netflix was "Saving Private
Ryan".  Surprisingly, I had not watched this movie earlier. Every time I watched the opening scene, I had simply given
up and that was enough of the movie for me.</p>
<p>Now, that I completely watched it, this movie just my regard for "Steven Speilberg" as the director. I can think of no
other movie that is as brilliant, portraying human emotions, as this one. The war is shown in its brutality. Soldiers
holding on religion as the moment of truth is shown dearly.</p>
<p>The characters in the movie include Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) who shows extraordinary leadership and Private Jackson
(Barry Pepper), a highly reliable, accurate marksman, who quotes bible, gives himself unto god, as he fights his
enemies.</p>
<p>Everything about this movie was great.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Emerald_Route">The Emerald Route</a> is a travelogue written by R. K. Narayan. He details the cultural and mythological history of
various cities in Karnataka. Narayan presents the mythological history alongside with the facts about the place, and
gives you a glimpse of his character. He presents them as true stories that have happened in those places.</p>
<p>For example, Narayan shares the story that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shankara">Sankara</a> was born with a definite time of 16 years to live, and thus he
studied all the scholarly works by 10, became a monk, and started preaching. When he was 16, a debate between <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vyasa">Vyasa</a>
and Sankara took place. Vyasa was the original author of the work that Sankara was discussing, and not knowing this,
Sankara was still holding on to his stance. When the debate did not end, student of Sankara called for truce. Ved Vyasa
impressed by Sankara's knowledge of his own work, granted him the boon to live for another 16 years.</p>
<p>There was another interesting story that at <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srirangapatna">Srirangapatinum</a>, in one of the battles that <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tipu_Sultan">Tipu Sultan</a> lost, he had
give away two of his sons, aged 9 and 11, as hostages to British on conditions of surrender. It seems that he got his
sons back after paying huge money to British.</p>
<p>Filled with stories like this, giving the account of history and culture of the various towns in Karnataka, this book
was a pleasure to read.</p>

<p>There are many supporting studies on this, and I came another one which explicitly stated that</p>
<p><strong>Praise for Intelligence Can Undermine Children's Motivation and Performance</strong></p>
<p>The study suggests that parents should praise their children for the efforts they put in their tasks instead of
praising the accomplishments or their intelligence for accomplishing the task.</p>
<p>Excerpt from the paper.</p>
<blockquote>
Praise for ability is commonly considered to have beneficial effects on motivation. Contrary to this
popular belief, six studies demonstrated that praise for intelligence had more negative consequences
for students' achievement motivation than praise for effort. Fifth graders praised for intelligence
were found to care more about performance goals relative to learning goals than children praised
for effort. After failure, they also displayed less task persistence, less task enjoyment, more lowability
attributions, and worse task performance than children praised for effort. Finally, children
praised for intelligence described it as a fixed trait more than children praised for hard work,
who believed it to be subject to improvement. These findings have important implications for how
achievement is best encouraged, as well as for more theoretical issues, such as the potential cost of
performance goals and the socialization of contingent self-worth.</blockquote>

<p>Design patterns like "Decorator", "Singleton" are common and be easily
recognized. The "Builder" pattern is also recognizable whenever you use Java's
<cite>StringBuilder</cite> class.</p>
<p>Some patterns which are commonly used by frameworks are not easily recognizable
unless you are a framework author.  Recently, I spent time trying to recognize
and understand <em>Abstract Factory</em> design pattern.</p>
<p>In this post, we will look at "Abstract Factory" and explain it with an
example. I consulted multiple resources, and ultimately to gain confidence, I
had to rely upon <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns">The Gang of Four</a> <a class="footnote-reference" href="posts/abstract-factory-design-pattern-explanation.html#id1" id="id2">[1]</a> design patterns book.</p>
<p>This post is intended as refresher for a reader who has read the <strong>Gang of
Four</strong> chapter on Abstract Factory. This post presents an example which the
reader can relate to in the modern world.</p>
<p>Abstract Factory is a Factory for Factories. To understand this, you will first
have to understand the Factory Design pattern, which encapsulates creation of
objects. Factory pattern is recognized when instead of using <cite>new SomeClass()</cite>
we call <cite>SomeClass.createObject()</cite> static method. The advantage is <cite>SomeClass</cite>
is independent of your code, it could be supplied as a dependency from someone
else and you simply use the factory. The person controlling the factory can
modify the object creation process.</p>
<p>For example, <cite>SomeClass.createObject()</cite> in version1, can be return <cite>new
SomeClass(arg1)</cite> and in version2, it can change to <cite>return new SomeClass(arg1,
arg2)</cite> with you as the caller, invoking the object creation entirely as
<cite>SomeClass.createObject()</cite> unaffected by the change made by the creator of
SomeClass.</p>
<p>Factory pattern is easy to understand. The next step comes in dealing with
Abstract Factory.</p>
<div class="section" id="intent">
<h2>Intent</h2>
<p>Abstract Factory provides an interface for creating families of related or
dependent objects without specifying the concrete classes.</p>

<h2>Design Problem</h2>
<p>In this problem, we are trying to design a "Operating System Installer" for
Unix family of Operating Systems. We know there are two popular variants of
<strong>Unix</strong>, there popular operating system with <strong>Linux kernel</strong> and related
application stack, and there is <strong>BSD</strong> systems.</p>
<p>Each Operating System will consists of components like</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Bootloader</li>
<li>Kernel</li>
<li>Shell</li>
<li>DisplayManager</li>
<li>WindowManager</li>
<li>Applications</li>
</ol>
<p>The installer will have to abstract those components and help the client create an <strong>Unix</strong> operating system choice.</p>

<p>Police shooting of the black men were disturbing. There are videos on the internet, I suggest that you don't watch
them, it just does not help. The men were shot for <em>no-good</em> reason and if I have take an alternate stance, it is
probably because the police officer had <em>fear and hatred</em> towards the other person that he shot them.</p>
<p>There are no excuses for the police officers who shot the black men. They should be jailed for their life term for this
act.</p>
<p>Later, the protest in Dallas to condemn the shooting, some people, who carried guns, which is legal in US, shot at the
officers and killed 5 of them. This is equally brutal. In addition, police used a robot to kill the suspect too.</p>
<p>I had to recollect "Gandhi's message of peace" that many Indians have been thought since childhood. It seems to me that
folks who cite, "Second Amendment" will really not understand either Gandhi's or Christ's message to mankind.</p>

<p><em>My Rating: 4/5</em></p>
<p>There is a decent chance that you must have heard about this movie. I had heard the
name too, had a vague idea from reading synopsis what I would expect.  But I was
totally wrong. After a point, I said to myself, it is no longer good vs. evil story.</p>
<p>It has a very thin storyline but has an excellent performance
from the villain, gripping scenes that will keep you absorbed.</p>
<p>I won't the read book, but I enjoyed watching the movie.</p>

<p>I joined <a class="reference external" href="http://www.twitter.com/mesosphere">@mesosphere</a> on June 20, 2016. It's exciting as I get to work on some interesting technology in <a class="reference external" href="http://dcos.io">Datacenter
Operating System</a>. The container technology and orchestration world is in rage right now. Mesosphere is suitably
positioned in that sphere. :)</p>
<p>The most interesting thing for me will be learn the distributed systems concepts well and contributed to this space.
Plus, I discovered that our infrastructure tools are completely in Python3. Yay for that!</p>

<p>Stumbled upon this LWN.net entry written by a Linux man-pages contributor. The main point of this
article was, documenting software projects quite early on can reveal important design and code
bugs. This presented three examples of how a feature in <strong>inotify</strong> call was introduced, but was
found not working while documenting it. Similar example was given for <em>splice</em> and <em>timerfd</em> calls</p>

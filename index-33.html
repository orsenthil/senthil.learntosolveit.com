<p>Read a brian pickings article titled <a class="reference external" href="https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/15/sam-harris-waking-up-spirituality/">Neuroscientist Sam Harris on Happiness, Spirituality Without Religion, and How to Cultivate the Art of Presence</a></p>
<p>The essence of this was discovering that feeling in that a person feels extremely comfortable
and happy with the self. That feeling is described using a loaded word called "spirituality" and
associated with religion. For folks who have experienced it, it is not related to religion at all.</p>
<p>It is outside of it. It is an innate existential feeling that one can get, when
a person is honest with his thoughts, feelings and happy for the present moment.</p>

<p>The name <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wesm">Wes McKinney</a> rang a bell when I was reading a general news article on a hedge-fund developer
talking about open source developer stresses. Then I realized that the created of <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas library</a>,  author
of the book <a class="reference external" href="http://wesmckinney.com/">Python for Data Analysis</a>  was working for 2-Sigma now. I also came to know that he is a
committer with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp">Apache Parquet</a> project, which is a C++ library for storing data in a columnar fashion.
With all these noteworthy implementations aside, Wes seems to have a background in statistics from MIT.</p>
<p>There are many interesting people whose work we use, sometimes unaware of the person behind the project.</p>

<p>CPython project moved it's source code hosting from self-hosted mercurial repository, at hg.python.org to Git
version control system hosted at Github. The new location of python project is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.github.com/python/cpython">http://www.github.com/python/cpython</a></p>
<p>This is second big version control migration that is happening since I got involved. The first one was when
we moved from svn to mercurial. Branches were sub-optimal in svn and we used svn-merge.py to merge across
branches. Mercurial helped there and everyone got used to a distributed version control written in python,
mercurial. It was interesting for me personally to compare mercurial with the other popular DVCS, git.</p>
<p>Over the years, Github has become popular place for developers to host their
projects. They have constantly improved their service offering. Many python
developers, got used to git version control system and found it's utility value too.</p>
<p>Two years ago, it was decided that Python will move to Git and Github. The <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/CPython-workflow-changes-mx1k8G6M0rg5JLy80F1r6">effort was led by
Bret Cannon</a>  assisted by number of other developers and the migration happened on Feb 10, 2017.</p>
<p>I helped with the migration too and helped with providing tool around converting the hg to git, using the facilities
available from hg-git mercurial plugin.</p>
<p>We made use hg-git, and wrote some conversions scripts that could get us to the converted repo as we wanted.</p>

<p>Now that the migration is done, we are getting ourselves familiar to the new workflow.</p>

<p>I came across an article on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashavant_Kanetkar">Yashwant Kanetkar</a>, and it rekindled many of my fond memories.</p>
<blockquote>
Let Us C is not merely a book, but a bible for millions of programmers in India.</blockquote>
<p>That is true for me. I had read it during years 2000-2002, and I kept a count of it. I read, solved all the
problems in that book for more than 100 times.</p>
<p>It has helped me a lot and I am indebted to that book.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://yourstory.com/2017/01/techie-tuesdays-yashavant-kanetkar/">article on Yashwant Kanetkar</a> was published in a Indian magazine, I made a
copy of it, because, as you can imagine, I will cherish it.</p>
<p>I also watched a short talk by Yaashwant Kanetkar in which he explores his journey, and has some words of advice for
programmers from India.</p>

<p>Few years ago, I wrote this n-puzzle using pygame for fun.  It was inspired from the
sliding block puzzle game that I had played as a kid, which had numerals in the front and
a picture of taj mahal in the back. The idea was to slide and fit the photo together.</p>

<li>Human plays first. Use Arrow Keys to Move and Fit the Picture.</li>

<p>Let's first watch this video</p>
<div class="youtube-video align-center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qINUIONARkE?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In this video, I just gave the program a game and it learned to play by itself. No, I did
not code the player, that would have been so traditional. Here the player, the computer, the
program, actually learns to play by itself by just playing the game! It does not need me.</p>
<p>I recorded this video for experiencing how a Deep learning algorithm actually works. And as you
can notice, it works amazingly! Deep learning is subset Artificial Intelligence that tries to show
"intelligent behavior" by using something similar to (neural networks) human brains wiring.
It uses mathematics, that we think, human brains internally use to exhibit rational thinking.</p>
<p>The results of these have been amazing. From beating go games (<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/thanks-for-ruining-another-game-forever-computers/">Thanks For Ruining Another
Game Forever, Computers</a>) , to making self-driving cars a possibility. The above video
should give some idea that self-driving cars can learn about hurdles and try to navigate by itself.</p>
<p><strong>How to setup your system for Deep Learning Experiment ?</strong></p>
<p>I wish, you will be excited to replicate this experiment. If you are interested, here is how I setup.</p>
<p>1. Rent a GPU Instance from AWS or Azure. Right now, we need GPUS. They are very costly, but the deep learning frameworks
are not optimized for CPUs. I spent multiple weeks of uptime on CPU without any results. Go for GPU. AWS Has it.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Setup <a class="reference external" href="http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2014/10/25/cuda-6-dot-5-on-aws-gpu-instance-running-ubuntu-14-dot-04/">Ubuntu 14.04 with proper NVIDIA</a> drivers.</li>
<li>Install X11 and Window Manager. It wont be fun otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop xfce
</pre>
<p>4. Setup viewing your powerful "Cloud Desktop" using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nomachine.com/">nomachine</a>.
Apparently, that's the best way I could setup remote graphic viewing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Clone the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kuz/DeepMind-Atari-Deep-Q-Learner">DeepMind-Atari-Deep-Q-Learner</a> code.</li>
<li>Install the dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
./install_dependencies.sh
</pre>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>And, as my son will say. <em>Here you go!</em>
</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
./run_gpu breakout
</pre>
<p>You can exit nomachine with the program running, and constantly come
back to monitor your computer trying to learn to play a game by itself.</p>

Inevitably, the first iteration of your Raft implementation will be buggy. So will the second. And third. And fourth. In general, each one will be less buggy than the previous one, and, from experience, most of your bugs will be a result of not faithfully following Figure 2.</blockquote>

<p>Glyph Lefkowitz is a great author. In this post titled <a class="reference external" href="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html">unyielding</a> he makes an excellent case against threads, with so
many valid references for his arguments. He makes a point event driven programs that should be the first thing we
should think if we are think about concurrency.</p>
<p>As a developer or project lead, if I have to emulate certain practices for a writing high quality software, I think,
looking up to glyph and his twisted project is never a mistake.</p>

<p>For my computer science paper reading, I picked up a paper called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf">SWIM - Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection style Process Group Membership Protocol</a>, which I bookmarked a while ago.</p>
<p>I must have come across this while taking the distributed systems course by <a class="reference external" href="http://indy.cs.illinois.edu/">Indranil Gupta</a> in Coursera.
This paper is interesting, approachable and tries to solve the problem of membership updates in distributed systems.</p>
<p>The primary motivation of this seems that heartbeat based member update seem not scalable, so they innovate on providing an alternate mechanism that can utilized for membership updates in a group.</p>
<p>The basic protocol uses the random-probing based failure detector protocol of and disseminates membership updates via
network multicast.</p>
<p>The core innovative concepts include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Epidemic style membership broadcast.</li>
<li>Suspicion-based failure detector protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>In turn these provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Constant message load (bandwidth) per member regardless of the number of members in the group</li>
<li>Constant time to first-detection of a faulty process regardless of the number of members in the group</li>
<li>Low false-positive failure detection rate</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to be a popular paper, and there are many implementations available in the web. I think, I must bookmarked this paper as suggestion to myself that these are interesting projects (in python) to attempt.</p>

<p>I was reading the paper on <a class="reference external" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf">Dominant Resource Fairness</a> and found it approachable, interesting and fairly easy to
understand.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alig/papers/drf.pdf">Dominant Resource Fairness</a> is a resource allocation strategy used by a system like <a class="reference external" href="http://mesos.apache.org/">Mesos</a>.</p>
<p>In general terms, resources are basically things that a group will need and the idea is the allocate the resources
amongst the members of the group in an efficient way. Examples could be the amount of money (resource) to be
distributed across a group of people in the community or the processor cores in a multi-core processor that needs to be
distributed and allocated to the process running on that processor.</p>
<p>The Dominant Resource Fairness uses <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming">Linear Programming</a> technique to solve the problem of resource sharing.</p>
<p>In a datacenter with multiple computers, having multiple CPUs, multiple memories, network cards and many other resources,
those needs to be shared across the processes that are running in the datacenter. DRF uses the concept of a dominant
resource. The Dominant share is the maximum share that an entity (process) has been allocated for any resource. For
e.g, if if a process A has heavy CPU usage and process B has heavy memory usage, the dominant resource for process A is
CPU and the dominant resource for process B is Memory.</p>
<p>Dominant Resource Fairness seeks to maximize the minimum dominant share across all entities. That's the formulation
for the linear programming problem for you. Doing it across in a distributed way for different tasks with different
requirements is the challenge that is being solved.</p>
<p>For example, if user A runs CPU-heavy tasks and user B runs memory-heavy tasks, the DRF attempts to equalize CPU share
of user A with the memory share of user B. In this case, the DRF would allocate more CPU and less memory to the tasks
run by user A, and allocate less CPU and more memory to the tasks run by user B. In the single resource case -- where
all jobs are requesting the same resources -- the DRF reduces to max-min fairness for that resource.</p>
<p>Some interesting anecdotes I found in the paper include, enforcing "fairness" in resource sharing is a difficult
problem by itself.</p>
<blockquote>
A big search company provided dedicated machines for jobs only if the users could guarantee high utilization. The
company soon found that users would sprinkle their code with infinite loops to artificially inflate utilization
levels.</blockquote>
<p>The paper also quoted economic research on difficultly in ensuring fairness.</p>
<blockquote>
Competitive equilibrium from equal incomes (CEEI), a popular fair allocation policy preferred in the micro-economic
domain is not strategy proof.</blockquote>

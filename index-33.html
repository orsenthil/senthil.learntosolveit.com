<p>I tried to determine the motivation behind a Travel Ban issued in US on March 6, 2017 against certain nations. I
tried to read the document directly instead of being influenced by numerous news articles.</p>
<p>My reading of the document, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">whose entire text is available here</a>, leads me to believe that this move is a
vindictive, politically motivated, irrational and causes harm to everyone living in US (not just the citizens).</p>
<p>Let's try to analyze this rationally and ask questions.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted and needy
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/Psalms-82-3/">Psalm 82:3-5</a></li>
</ul>
<p>No matter what your identity is, as a human, you are taught to protect the weak, stand-up against cruelty. If you
protect the weak when you are strong, rationally someone else will keep you safe when you come become in your old age.</p>
<p><strong>Who are refugees and what is their process to come to the US?</strong></p>
<p>Refugee a person who has been forced to leave their country to escape war, persecution, or natural disaster.</p>
<p>If you are a Tamil speaking person, you can identify the refugees as Sri Lankan Tamil's who fled to TamilNadu due
to oppression based on race and language.</p>
<p>Safe and Sound nations welcome refugees as part of their commitment towards peace of the world.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>India, after vetting, keeping in line with it's broad mindedness, welcomes refugees.</li>
<li>US follows a 2-year of vetting, and so far with it's broadmindedness has welcomed refugees too.</li>
<li>Britain, vets and welcomes them.</li>
<li>Australia, vets and welcomes them.</li>
<li>Germany, vets and welcomes them.</li>
</ul>
<p>What happens when you block refugees from certain countries for a short period of time?</p>
<p>Nothing changes in practice. In theory, you create an opinion and give a signal to other countries
and your territory is not a safe place. If that is not the situation, you are just oppressing
the weak. This is happening with the United States banning people from certain nations.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It is politically motivated by a coward at the top of the government who signed this.</li>
<li>It is vindictive and reactionary to the defeat received from the judicial system trying to hold up
humanities for the country.</li>
<li>It is creating divisive identity-politics, harboring people who side with racism and are phobic towards
Islam religion in America.</li>
<li>It is giving way to hate crimes by racist-terrorists in America. Indians in first week of March 2017, were
subjected to this with 2 deaths and 1 person wound with injuries due to racially induced gun-violence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, to the text of this travel-ban:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states">https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/03/06/executive-order-protecting-nation-foreign-terrorist-entry-united-states</a></p>
<p>The title says "Foreign Terrorists". In fact, US has 2 years to vet any applicant and determine if the person is a
terrorist or not. This ban for 90 days is undermining the 2-years of vetting period.</p>
<p>The claim is:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
It is therefore the policy of the United States to improve the screening and vetting
protocols and procedures associated with the visa-issuance process and the USRAP
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What can a 90-day ban achieve, which could not be done for more than 730 days? The document fails to answer that.</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  These are countries that had already been
identified as presenting heightened concerns about terrorism and travel to the United States.
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where is the proof?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
Additionally, Members of Congress have expressed concerns about screening and
vetting procedures following recent terrorist attacks in this country and in Europe.
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>What concern have they expressed and where is the proof? The terrorist attacks from the people of the above nation
in US is 0. Why have not the members of congress raised concerns for racially induced gun-violence?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
Nationals from the countries previously identified under section 217(a)(12) of the INA warrant additional scrutiny
in connection with our immigration policies because the conditions in these countries present heightened threats.
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Where is the proof?</li>
</ul>
<pre class="literal-block">
The following are brief descriptions, taken in part from the Department of State's Country Reports on Terrorism 2015 (June 2016), of some of the conditions in six of the previously designated countries that demonstrate why their nationals continue to present heightened risks to the security of the United States:
</pre>
<p>It then, provides snippets on the crimes committed by the Individuals from the countries.</p>
<p>We can look at the entire list, which is claimed as an authoritative reference: <a class="reference external" href="https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/">https://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/crt/2015/</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Why is it citing the reports from 2015 for a 90 day action in 2017?</li>
<li>There are other nations in the list, why pick up only 7?</li>
<li>What has changed in 1 months that a travel-ban on Iraq is no longer included and <strong>suddenly</strong> that is considered safe?</li>
</ul>
<p>This is answered here.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
In addition, since Executive Order 13769 was issued, the Iraqi government has expressly undertaken
steps to enhance travel documentation, information sharing, and the return of Iraqi nationals subject
to final orders of removal.  Decisions about issuance of visas or granting admission to Iraqi nationals
should be subjected to additional scrutiny to determine if applicants have connections with ISIS or
other terrorist organizations, or otherwise pose a risk to either national security or public safety.
</pre>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If this is the case, just call the requirement that provide "travel documentation".</li>
<li>This still does not justify the prejudice displayed with countries as a whole.</li>
</ul>
<p>The ban, tries to support itself by giving some examples like this.</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Recent history shows that some of those who have entered the United States
through our immigration system have proved to be threats to our national security.
</pre>
<p>The incident is this one: <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Portland_car_bomb_plot">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Portland_car_bomb_plot</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The person involved did not have a ground from Somalia. What makes the claim that the entire country is at fault?</li>
<li>Why is the 2010 incident being referenced for this Ban? Where are the incidents for other countries?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are the glaring holes in the document.This was signed by someone who did not
take effort to read the document. It was prepared by the salespeople for money.</p>
<p>As new challenges crop up, this bad-act will be forgotten soon. Keeping quiet does not seem to be right thing to do.
Let us be aware, spread correct information and help to bring bad-actors down.</p>

<p>The essence of this was discovering that feeling in that a person feels extremely comfortable
and happy with the self. That feeling is described using a loaded word called "spirituality" and
associated with religion. For folks who have experienced it, it is not related to religion at all.</p>
<p>It is outside of it. It is an innate existential feeling that one can get, when
a person is honest with his thoughts, feelings and happy for the present moment.</p>

<p>The name <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/wesm">Wes McKinney</a> rang a bell when I was reading a general news article on a hedge-fund developer
talking about open source developer stresses. Then I realized that the created of <a class="reference external" href="http://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas library</a>,  author
of the book <a class="reference external" href="http://wesmckinney.com/">Python for Data Analysis</a>  was working for 2-Sigma now. I also came to know that he is a
committer with <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/apache/parquet-cpp">Apache Parquet</a> project, which is a C++ library for storing data in a columnar fashion.
With all these noteworthy implementations aside, Wes seems to have a background in statistics from MIT.</p>
<p>There are many interesting people whose work we use, sometimes unaware of the person behind the project.</p>

<p>CPython project moved it's source code hosting from self-hosted mercurial repository, at hg.python.org to Git
version control system hosted at Github. The new location of python project is <a class="reference external" href="http://www.github.com/python/cpython">http://www.github.com/python/cpython</a></p>
<p>This is second big version control migration that is happening since I got involved. The first one was when
we moved from svn to mercurial. Branches were sub-optimal in svn and we used svn-merge.py to merge across
branches. Mercurial helped there and everyone got used to a distributed version control written in python,
mercurial. It was interesting for me personally to compare mercurial with the other popular DVCS, git.</p>
<p>Over the years, Github has become popular place for developers to host their
projects. They have constantly improved their service offering. Many python
developers, got used to git version control system and found it's utility value too.</p>
<p>Two years ago, it was decided that Python will move to Git and Github. The <a class="reference external" href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/CPython-workflow-changes-mx1k8G6M0rg5JLy80F1r6">effort was led by
Bret Cannon</a>  assisted by number of other developers and the migration happened on Feb 10, 2017.</p>
<p>I helped with the migration too and helped with providing tool around converting the hg to git, using the facilities
available from hg-git mercurial plugin.</p>
<p>We made use hg-git, and wrote some conversions scripts that could get us to the converted repo as we wanted.</p>

<p>Now that the migration is done, we are getting ourselves familiar to the new workflow.</p>

<p>I came across an article on <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yashavant_Kanetkar">Yashwant Kanetkar</a>, and it rekindled many of my fond memories.</p>
<blockquote>
Let Us C is not merely a book, but a bible for millions of programmers in India.</blockquote>
<p>That is true for me. I had read it during years 2000-2002, and I kept a count of it. I read, solved all the
problems in that book for more than 100 times.</p>
<p>It has helped me a lot and I am indebted to that book.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://yourstory.com/2017/01/techie-tuesdays-yashavant-kanetkar/">article on Yashwant Kanetkar</a> was published in a Indian magazine, I made a
copy of it, because, as you can imagine, I will cherish it.</p>
<p>I also watched a short talk by Yaashwant Kanetkar in which he explores his journey, and has some words of advice for
programmers from India.</p>

<p>Few years ago, I wrote this n-puzzle using pygame for fun.  It was inspired from the
sliding block puzzle game that I had played as a kid, which had numerals in the front and
a picture of taj mahal in the back. The idea was to slide and fit the photo together.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/orsenthil/who-slides-wins">https://github.com/orsenthil/who-slides-wins</a></p>
<p><strong>How to play</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Human plays first. Use Arrow Keys to Move and Fit the Picture.</li>
<li>Press Enter when Done.</li>
<li>Computer Plays and tries to beat you with less moves that you took.</li>
</ol>
<p>It uses A* with Manhattan Distances to Solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>If you want to try it on your computer.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Install python2.7</li>
<li>Create a virtualenv.</li>
<li>pip install pygame</li>
<li>clone the git repo.</li>
<li>python run_game.py</li>

<p>Let's first watch this video</p>
<div class="youtube-video align-center">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qINUIONARkE?rel=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allow="encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>In this video, I just gave the program a game and it learned to play by itself. No, I did
not code the player, that would have been so traditional. Here the player, the computer, the
program, actually learns to play by itself by just playing the game! It does not need me.</p>
<p>I recorded this video for experiencing how a Deep learning algorithm actually works. And as you
can notice, it works amazingly! Deep learning is subset Artificial Intelligence that tries to show
"intelligent behavior" by using something similar to (neural networks) human brains wiring.
It uses mathematics, that we think, human brains internally use to exhibit rational thinking.</p>
<p>The results of these have been amazing. From beating go games (<a class="reference external" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/thanks-for-ruining-another-game-forever-computers/">Thanks For Ruining Another
Game Forever, Computers</a>) , to making self-driving cars a possibility. The above video
should give some idea that self-driving cars can learn about hurdles and try to navigate by itself.</p>
<p><strong>How to setup your system for Deep Learning Experiment ?</strong></p>
<p>I wish, you will be excited to replicate this experiment. If you are interested, here is how I setup.</p>
<p>1. Rent a GPU Instance from AWS or Azure. Right now, we need GPUS. They are very costly, but the deep learning frameworks
are not optimized for CPUs. I spent multiple weeks of uptime on CPU without any results. Go for GPU. AWS Has it.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>Setup <a class="reference external" href="http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2014/10/25/cuda-6-dot-5-on-aws-gpu-instance-running-ubuntu-14-dot-04/">Ubuntu 14.04 with proper NVIDIA</a> drivers.</li>
<li>Install X11 and Window Manager. It wont be fun otherwise.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
sudo apt-get install xubuntu-desktop xfce
</pre>
<p>4. Setup viewing your powerful "Cloud Desktop" using <a class="reference external" href="https://www.nomachine.com/">nomachine</a>.
Apparently, that's the best way I could setup remote graphic viewing.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="5">
<li>Clone the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/kuz/DeepMind-Atari-Deep-Q-Learner">DeepMind-Atari-Deep-Q-Learner</a> code.</li>
<li>Install the dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
./install_dependencies.sh
</pre>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="7">
<li>And, as my son will say. <em>Here you go!</em>
</li>
</ol>
<pre class="literal-block">
./run_gpu breakout
</pre>
<p>You can exit nomachine with the program running, and constantly come
back to monitor your computer trying to learn to play a game by itself.</p>

<p>I think, when trying to understand these algorithms trying to implement them is the only way to "get it".</p>
<p>As this article titled <a class="reference external" href="https://thesquareplanet.com/blog/students-guide-to-raft/">Students' Guide to Raft</a>  notes</p>
<blockquote>
Inevitably, the first iteration of your Raft implementation will be buggy. So will the second. And third. And fourth. In general, each one will be less buggy than the previous one, and, from experience, most of your bugs will be a result of not faithfully following Figure 2.</blockquote>

<p>Glyph Lefkowitz is a great author. In this post titled <a class="reference external" href="https://glyph.twistedmatrix.com/2014/02/unyielding.html">unyielding</a> he makes an excellent case against threads, with so
many valid references for his arguments. He makes a point event driven programs that should be the first thing we
should think if we are think about concurrency.</p>
<p>As a developer or project lead, if I have to emulate certain practices for a writing high quality software, I think,
looking up to glyph and his twisted project is never a mistake.</p>

<p>For my computer science paper reading, I picked up a paper called <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~asdas/research/dsn02-swim.pdf">SWIM - Scalable Weakly-consistent Infection style Process Group Membership Protocol</a>, which I bookmarked a while ago.</p>
<p>I must have come across this while taking the distributed systems course by <a class="reference external" href="http://indy.cs.illinois.edu/">Indranil Gupta</a> in Coursera.
This paper is interesting, approachable and tries to solve the problem of membership updates in distributed systems.</p>
<p>The primary motivation of this seems that heartbeat based member update seem not scalable, so they innovate on providing an alternate mechanism that can utilized for membership updates in a group.</p>
<p>The basic protocol uses the random-probing based failure detector protocol of and disseminates membership updates via
network multicast.</p>
<p>The core innovative concepts include:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Epidemic style membership broadcast.</li>
<li>Suspicion-based failure detector protocol.</li>
</ul>
<p>In turn these provide:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Constant message load (bandwidth) per member regardless of the number of members in the group</li>
<li>Constant time to first-detection of a faulty process regardless of the number of members in the group</li>
<li>Low false-positive failure detection rate</li>
</ul>
<p>This seems to be a popular paper, and there are many implementations available in the web. I think, I must bookmarked this paper as suggestion to myself that these are interesting projects (in python) to attempt.</p>

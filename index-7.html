<p>I knew it by "Chinese New Year" only and this year is "the year of Pig" with increase in birthrate projected in China as they believe children bring prosperity in this year.</p>
<p>Found googles doodle linked to "Lunar New Year" instead of "Chinese New year". Globalization or lessons learnt for Chinese market? :-)</p>
<p>Wikipedia says,Lunar New Year is Celebrated by: China, Taiwan, South and North Korea, Japan, Mongolia, Vietnam, Singapore.</p>
<p>Happy New year all of you guys.</p>

<p>At How Stuff works, found this interesting article titled: "<a href="http://science.howstuffworks.com/love.htm">How Love Works</a>". According to this article,</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>People often tend to fall in love with people in whom they see their parents, siblings. With whom they have been associated from childhood.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eye contacts and looking deep into the eyes, has an effect in two people falling in love.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love, relationship, Lust, Passionate Love, Infidelity etc is explained entirely as a chemical phenomena. Get to know your adrenaline, dopamine, norepinephrine, phenylethylamine, etc.</p>

<p>On Self-Purification:</p>
<p><i>Love and Ahimsa are matchless in their effect. But, in their play there is no fuss, show, noise or placards. They presuppose self-confidence which in its turn presupposes self-purification. Men of stainless character and self-purification will easily inspire confidence and automatically purify the atmosphere around them.<br>~Mahatma Gandhi.</i></p>

<i>I'd crawl over an acre of 'Visual This++' and 'Integrated Development That' to get to gcc, Emacs, and gdb. Thank you." </i>(By Vance Petree, Virginia Power)
<p>That was a fun quote I stumbled upon and totally unrelated is the rest of the post which follows.</p>
<hr>
<p>I watched Guru the second time. Believe me, the movie was lot better the second time and its point of capitalism was more convincing than before, when one already knows what this movie is about. Second time watching the thoughts of Dhirubhai Ambani or Bill Gates did not come, while the rationale behind the arguements and thoughts of Gurubhai was more prominent.</p>

<p>Vaish,Shiva,Parthiban,Priya and I visited flower show at Lalbagh on 26th Jan. Variety of flowers were displayed, and I can hardly remember the names. Few of the bonsai costs Rs.5000/- and above. But bonsai was very nice. You could see a full grown dwarf trees. :-)</p>
<p>I captured few the flowers with my camera till my batteries went down and I could not buy a new set of batteries inside lalbagh. </p>

<p>The history department of Middlebury College has taken measures to <a href="http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2007/01/26/wiki">stop CITATIONS from wikipedia</a> for the Student Research paper. Yeah, thats infact the correc thing to do. For research we always should go the primary source and if not possible well researched secondary source having a relation to the primary source. </p>
<p>Wikipedia being so useful that students had ended citing that up in the their papers and when there was a mis-information in the wikipedia, the students did not know that and their papers went wrong. The teachers doing a correct move as they say cite wikipedia at your own peril.</p>

It is an excellent book which deals with the stories of many physicists working during the prime time of physics. It starts with RutherFords story about his rustic nature and how he used to work in his lab. <br>I was amazed by the story of Max Plank that I have decided to keep Max Plank as an example of being organized and disciplined in life.<br>Max Plank was very organized it seems. He used to come to lab, almost at the same time and daily he had set 1/2 hour of learning piano and work style was appreciated by many. Einstein and many others respected and loved him and addressed as "our plank". Later in Einsteins story came to know that Einstein resigned from post in Germany during the troubled Nazi area, as knew that it would come up on Plank to take the decision of removing Einstein and Plank would be feeling uncomfortable doing it. Einstein then had moved to Princeton and German political situation was bad under Hilter.<br>One funny thing, I can recollec is, in of the anti Einstein meetings, Einstein was present in the audience and enjoying it. <br>Niels Bohr is another scientist whom we come to know in detail. He along with Einstein was the primary characters in this book. Bohr had established an institute where lots of young physicists loved to study and conduct experiments. Physicists who ever had been there feel it was the golden era. The final topic is on Einstein and Bohrs debate, Einstein feels that there is an organized approach in God design of universe wherein Bohrs point of argument ( as I understood) is we have not understood the organization of universe yet to comment on it.<br>Bohr was an athelete and used to go for short sprints between scientific discussions and debates it seems. :-)<br><br>Many of my friends will enjoy this book. Jonathan gifted me this while at college and Kannapan feels this as one of the best book he has ever read.<br><br>I took some snaps of the middle page pictures using my nokia 6600.<br><br>http://www.flickr.com/photos/phoe6/tags/physics/show/</p>

<p>From Spastics Society of Karnataka Recreation club we all went to movie <a href="http://www2.warnerbros.com/happyfeet/">Happy Feet</a> today.</p>
<p>Its a wonderful movie and one of the very good ones i have seen ever. The imagination of the animators will always bring a smile (an expression of wonder) in your face when you are watching the movie. With the first half filled with loads of fun, the second part takes a more serious turn where it appeals to human a concern for nature and shows the damage are doing. While watching the movie, you will being to show a lot of concern for mumble, the protognist, and wish him that he succeeds in his mission which you have begun to appreciate.</p>
<p>The movie has a star studded voice cast and the animation is just amazing! Kudoes to the australian team which worked on that. </p>
<p>Everyone of us who went, tried the tap dance at the end of happy feet.</p>
<p>Had a good time.</p>
<p>btw, I got into a habit of reading <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_Feet">wikipedia article on the movie</a> after I watch any movie. They provide a lot of interesting information and trivia. </p>
<p>We were discussing that LoveLace is voiced by Robbin Williams, but Ramon is also Robbin Williams. And mumble is Elijah Wood ( Frodo in LoTR), Ramya had forgot his name but she pointed out that its main character from LoTR. The group 4 fun-loving group of small penguins who call themselves amigos in the movie is a category called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adelie_Penguin">Adelie</a>. Mumble and others are Emperor penguins and emperor penguins in reality get together with their soul mates using songs only! :-) The movie is decided to Steve Irvin. </p>
<p>Happy feet is another good one from Australia.</p>

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Tintin">The Adventures of Tintin</a> was the Wikipedia Featured Article on January 5th. Dont miss reading that article. Its well researched and provides many interesting details to fans Tintin all over the world.  Few things which I liked and noted:
<p><i></i></p>
<p>The comic strip series has long been admired for its clean, expressive drawings in Hergé's signature <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ligne_claire">ligne claire</a> style.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>On June 1, 2006, the Dalai Lama bestowed the International Campaign for Tibet's Light of Truth award upon the character of Tintin, along with South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu.The award was in recognition of Hergé's book Tintin in Tibet, which the Executive Director of ICT Europe Tsering Jampa noted was "(f)or many ... their introduction to the awe-inspiring landscape and culture of Tibet".Accepting on behalf of the Hergé Foundation, Hergé's widow Fanny Rodwell declared: "We never thought that this story of friendship would have a resonance more than 40 years later".</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Charles de Gaulle once said "My only international rival is Tintin."</p>

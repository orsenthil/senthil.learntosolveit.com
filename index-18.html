<p>Richard M Stallman talks about it. I wholeheartedly agree with his claim. Programming is a craft, not a science, it cannot and should not been seen as academic exercise, like reading books, solving problems from scratch and feeling complete, but programming should help you build something, contribute to building of something, like you can contribute to an existing Free Software.</p>
<p>Excellent point.</p>

<p>I have not owned any high-end audio system and i have only known Bose audio systems as one of the high-end and costliest ones. Recently did I come to know about the man behind Bose Audio systems and his passion for <a class="zem_slink" title="Acoustics" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustics" target="_blank" rel="wikipedia">acoustics</a>. <a class="zem_slink" title="Amar Bose" href="http://www.bose.com/remember/index.html" target="_blank" rel="homepage">Amar Bose</a> went for quality research in acoustics and implemented them with his company Bose corporation.  I admire <a class="zem_slink" title="Bose Corporation" href="http://www.bose.com/" target="_blank" rel="homepage">the Bose corporation</a>'s stance on concentrating on quality and not forsaking that for market conditions.</p>
<blockquote>“I would have been fired a hundred times at a company run by M.B.A.’s. But I never went into business to make money. I went into business so that I could do interesting things that hadn’t been done before.” - Amar Bose</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2013/obit-amar-bose-0712.html">MIT News</a> highlights his contributions in this field, his research and teaching.</p>
<p>Also, watch this video of <a href="http://video.mit.edu/watch/dr-amar-g-bose-last-lecture-of-fall-96-acoustics-course-6698/" target="_blank">Dr. Amar Bose</a> sharing his experience to his students on his final lecture. He invites his TA's to share about their experience teaching and then goes on the share his experience as a young graduate student, drafted by his professors, who had confidence in him to take up a Maths problem of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener">Norbert Wiener</a>, when he was not a maths major and he shares his relationship with Norbert Wiener and how it all got started. Later he shares an anecdote on how the same "boring" job given to two students was taken up them in two different thought processes and how it changed the whole experience for them. The point which Dr. Bose is trying to make is, "we are never given a bad card", it is only how we make up in life.</p>

<p>Answer by Marcus Geduld:</p>
<blockquote>- I like creating something out of nothing. That's not literally what you do when you're programming, because there's existing hardware and software that serves as a foundation for your work, but it sure feels that way. Someone has an idea and you build it from the ground up. When you begin, there's just an empty text editor. When you're done, there's a (hopefully) working program.<br><br>- I like building things people use. It's amazing to type up some code, press a button, and suddenly thousands of people on the Internet are playing with it.<br><br>- I like playing God. Programming allows you to build little worlds and then play with them, making adjustments and watching the effects. It's like owning a toy planet and saying, "I'm going to make it rain, today. Oh, look! All the little people have opened umbrellas!" This playing-God aspect of programming makes it similar to writing novels, painting paintings, or directing plays. <br><br>- I like working within systems that demand precision. This is exactly what some people hate about programming, but it thrills me. A misplaced semicolon or the smallest typo can be disastrous. This keeps me on my toes. It's like being the butler on "Downton Abbey" or "Upstairs, Downstairs." Everything must be just so. Some people like precision; others like being about to say, "I can't describe it, but you know what I mean..." I'm the former type.<br><br>- I like solving puzzles. If you want to see if programming is for you, try out this puzzle book: <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-Schemer-Daniel-P-Friedman/dp/0262560992/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1372020695&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+little+schemer" class="external_link" target="_blank">The Little Schemer - 4th Edition: Daniel P. Friedman, Matthias Felleisen, Duane Bibby, Gerald J. Sussman: 9780262560993: Amazon.com: Books</a></span><br><br>- I like research. Programming tends to involve much googling and reading through documentation. <br><br>- I like experimenting. There's a large component of trial-and-error.<br><br>- I like writing poetry, which is very similar to programming. Both the poet and the programmer are obsessed with words, obsessed with formal rules, obsessed with seeing how far they can push those rules, and obsessed with expressiveness. Programmers often talk about how expressive a particular programming language is. They mean something very similar to what a poet means when he tries to come up with expressive wording.<br><br>Both poetry and code can be exquisitely beautiful -- and in very similar ways. People are often surprised that I'm a programmer who also directs Shakespeare plays, but I've met lots of programmers who are into Shakespeare, crossword puzzles, scrabble, and so on. <span class="qlink_container"><a href="http://www.quora.com/Joshua-Engel">Joshua Engel</a></span> is another Quora user who writes code and directs Shakespeare plays. <br><br>- I like communicating. Most good programmers will tell you that code is first-and-foremost meant to be read by people -- even to the extent that we'll sometimes write it in a way that is inefficient but easy-to-read. <br><br>- "<i>There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things." -- Phil Karlton. </i>I love the hard work of "naming things." Programmers generally have to come up with short words or phrases that label parts of the systems they're writing. It's crucial that these names be clear and apt. <br><br>Why? Because if you name something cButton, the next guy who has to work on your code may be befuddled. If you'd called it closeButton, he would have instantly known what you were referring to. Sometimes "he" is <i>me</i> a few weeks (or a year) later, when I'm reading my own code. It's embarrassing to come across cButton and think, "What did I mean by that?"<br><br>Last week, I was modifying someone else's code. It was for as web page with sections. Each section had a logo at the top. The original programmer had referred to those logos internally as "headers," e.g. "header1" and "header2." I didn't notice that, and so I named something <i>within </i>one of the sections "header." When I later looked over the code, I got totally confused between his headers and mine. <br><br>Then I thought it over and realized that his "headers" were always graphical logos and mine were text. So I renamed his "logo1" and "logo2" and mine "title." <br><br>This is just one small example of the sort of naming issues that constantly crop up. You either enjoy this sort of thing or you don't. I do.<br><br>- I like learning. Like sharks, programmers die if they stop moving. Because technology changes so fast, being a programmer means that "school" never stops. Even though I've been coding for years, I must constantly read programming books, follow blogs, and so on. There's no coasting! <br><br>I got into the game as a Flash programmer, which was lucrative for about ten years. Now Flash seems to be on its way out, so it's back to the books! But even while I was mostly coding Actionscript (Flash's language), I needed constant training, because that language went through many versions, some as different from each other as Spanish is from Portuguese. <br><br>There are many good programming books and courses, but you can't really learn to code by instruction. That will get you started, but they only real way to learn is to write code, fail, analyse the failure, and learn from it. So you must enjoy being an autodidact. I do.<br><br>- I like being a detective. Maybe 60% of programming is debugging -- figuring out how something works. That often means a ton of sleuth work. Sometimes you have to pick and entire program apart and put it back together again. <br><br>- I like solitary work. Programming allows me to do lots of that.<br><br>- I like collaborating. Nowadays, Few programmers work completely alone. Most are part of a team, and they spend part of the week doing close work with others and part in isolation. I feel a strong need for both sorts of work, and I like alternating between the two.</blockquote>

<p>30 years of K&amp;R is being celebrated.</p>
<p>This is an important book our life time and Inform IT has an article on "<a href="http://www.informit.com/promotions/promotion.aspx?promo=138913">Leading Programmers Remember the Impact of The C Programming Language</a>"</p>
<p>Roughly around <a href="http://sarovar.org/plugins/scmcvs/cvsweb.php/CVSROOT/?cvsroot=uthcode">10 years ago</a> to get myself into Software Development, I <a href="http://www.uthcode.com/cprogramming.html">started solving all the problems</a> at the end of the K&amp;R book and bootstrapped my Project <a href="http://www.uthcode.com">Uthcode</a> for the third time.  I can safely say that it turned out be successful and I owe greatly to this one book.</p>
<p>Later when I started <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/python/contributors/111669178856">contributing to Python</a>, I focussed mostly on Python and standard library which is written in Python.  Noticing how other programmers went about with CPython core, I wanted to re-read it to get into K&amp;R get into implementation and design. That has not happened yet, but I am planning for it sometime soonish. I can get back and rely on K&amp;R, plus I will have my experience to draw upon.</p>

<p>Every once in a while you come across some amazing and something insanely creative by unknown folks in the internet. I have decided to capture those moments by title "The Incredibles" series.</p>
<p>Today, it happened to me. After doing a basic drawing tutorial at Khan Academy I saw a spin off program which I thought is a image loaded. I wondered why some one spun off a simple drawing tutorial and then loaded image for practice. But I was wrong. This whole image was drawn using rects and fill.</p>

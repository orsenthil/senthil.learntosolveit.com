<p>Ode to a School Computer</p>
<p>By David Ahl</p>
<p>I was stay'in after school a week or so ago</p>
<p>'Cause I told a teacher where she could go</p>
<p>She had me settin' in this big old room</p>
<p>With a bunch of machines that just looked like doom</p>
<p>There's this big Mutha machine with flashing' lights</p>
<p>And a couple of funny-looking' electric typewrites</p>
<p>Well I thought I'd type somethin' for the fun of it</p>
<p>So I hunted and pecked out just one word - "shit"</p>
<p>Before I could lean back in my chair and get steady</p>
<p>That machine typed WHAT, and then it said READY</p>
<p>So I typed a whole line of them four-letter words</p>
<p>But it just replied WHAT and READY like it hadn't heard</p>
<p>Well I figured since I couldn't go out fishin'</p>
<p>I'd teach that stupid machine to listen</p>
<p>So I picked up this book called Teach yourself BASIC</p>
<p>And sat down at that Teletype prepared to face it</p>
<p>First I found to make that machine type my bit</p>
<p>I just had to put a PRINT in front of it</p>
<p>And then I found out that thing could add</p>
<p>And subtract and multiply and divide like mad</p>
<p>I found out too it knew all kinds of games</p>
<p>Like craps and blackjack and a cannon to aim</p>
<p>I was havin' all kinds of fun when that teacher walked in</p>
<p>She just looked at my output and started to grin</p>
<p>I kind of sheepishly asked  if I could stay a while more</p>
<p>She said: "Sure; when you just shut the door".</p>
<p>I tried some more games like football and poker</p>
<p>And a parachute jump written by some kind of joker</p>
<p>There was one where I could try to land on the moon</p>
<p>It would crash and blow up if fired the engines too soon</p>
<p>Well, I played on through supper and into the night</p>
<p>And then finally quit when I saw dawn's first light.</p>
<p>Some girls, I know are while lot cuter</p>
<p>But  I found a new kind of high with that computer.</p>

<p><br>Had stumbled across a detailed information on this incident on <a href="http://usr.blogspot.com/2004/12/bhopal-disaster.html">Dec 3 2004</a>, when I decided that I should be reading this book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Begins with the story of Ratan Nadar, a typical Advasi Indian peasant and the story follows his and his family's destiny. Without any kind of rhetoric nature, the story goes in a detailed manner presenting most of the information objectively. Ratan Nadar's children aged 5,6 and 8 going to work a match factory and handling toxic chemical which onces catches fire and padmini, the eldest discovers her brother dead.</p>
<p><br>Ratan like many others continuosly faces hardships in his village. He moves to Bhopal,a big city,gets a job as a worker constructing the Bhopal Railway station.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Union Carbide discovers sevin pesticide,which can improve the crop productivity. Plans to establish a factory in India, Bhopal. The chief architect Eduardo Munoz doubts the need for UC like factory in India, feeling the nature of India and its problems, but UC's board of directors get better of him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The motives are profit! But story reveals several earnest people establishing and working at the UC Plant in India and how Union Carbide is a dream company.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Things take a turn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The book is about the people living at Oriya Bustee, Kali Ghats, their custom and their work and their relationship with UC. How things change. How people help each other when the real need arises. How people are indifferent to each other. How can some indifferent attitudes prove too costly.</p>

<p><br><b>The Right to Read</b>  by <a href="http://www.stallman.org">rms</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p> <em>This article appeared in the February 1997 issue of <strong>Communications of the ACM</strong> (Volume 40, Number 2).</em></p>   <blockquote><p>         (from "The Road To Tycho", a collection of articles          about the antecedents of the Lunarian Revolution,           published in Luna City in 2096) </p></blockquote>   <p> For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college--when Lissa Lenz asked to borrow his computer.  Hers had broken down, and unless she could borrow another, she would fail her midterm project.  There was no one she dared ask, except Dan.</p>   <p> This put Dan in a dilemma.  He had to help her--but if he lent her his computer, she might read his books.  Aside from the fact that you could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your books, the very idea shocked him at first.  Like everyone, he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong--something that only pirates would do.</p>   <p> And there wasn't much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection Authority--would fail to catch him.  In his software class, Dan had learned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and where it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing.  (They used this information to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal interest profiles to retailers.)  The next time his computer was networked, Central Licensing would find out.  He, as computer owner, would receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent the crime.</p>   <p> Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books.  She might want the computer only to write her midterm.  But Dan knew she came from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition, let alone her reading fees.  Reading his books might be the only way she could graduate.  He understood this situation; he himself had had to borrow to pay for all the research papers he read.  (10% of those fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)</p>   <p> Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to pay.  There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages without government library grants.  But in the 1990s, both commercial and nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access. By 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature were a dim memory.</p>   <p> There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central Licensing.  They were themselves illegal.  Dan had had a classmate in software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool, and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading books.  But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were easily tempted into betrayal).  In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.</p>   <p> Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have debugging tools.  There were even free debugging tools available on CD or downloadable over the net.  But ordinary users started using them to bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this had become their principal use in actual practice.  This meant they were illegal; the debuggers' developers were sent to prison.</p>   <p> Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to officially licensed and bonded programmers.  The debugger Dan used in software class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be used only for class exercises.</p>   <p> It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a modified system kernel.  Dan would eventually find out about the free kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around the turn of the century.  But not only were they illegal, like debuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing your computer's root password.  And neither the FBI nor Microsoft Support would tell you that.</p>   <p> Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer.  But he couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her.  Every chance to speak with her filled him with delight.  And that she chose him to ask for help, that could mean she loved him too.</p>   <p> Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he lent her the computer, and told her his password.  This way, if Lissa read his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them.  It was still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about it.  They would only find out if Lissa reported him.</p>   <p> Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his own password, it would be curtains for both of them as students, regardless of what she had used it for.  School policy was that any interference with their means of monitoring students' computer use was grounds for disciplinary action.  It didn't matter whether you did anything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the administrators to check on you.  They assumed this meant you were doing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it was.</p>   <p> Students were not usually expelled for this--not directly.  Instead they were banned from the school computer systems, and would inevitably fail all their classes.</p>   <p> Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started only in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began using computers.  Previously, universities maintained a different approach to student discipline; they punished activities that were harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.</p>   <p> Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA.  His decision to help her led to their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been taught about piracy as children.  The couple began reading about the history of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on copying, and even the original United States Constitution.  They moved to Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from the long arm of the SPA.  When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.</p> <p></p>

<p>Well, it should have not taken so long to read it full. But had got that book when I was not in touch with reading books.</p>
<p><br>Had met Manish at one of our BLUG meets and he had that book, I kindda wondered what this new book was and was looking through it. Just expected not another kind of  "<span style="font-style:italic;">Count your eggs before they chicken</span>" kindda crap. I have not read those, but really dont like to. Dont know why. Perhaps try to read them some time :)</p>
<p><br>But Manish's review was, if you have enjoyed Dil Chata Hai, you might like this as well and he offered to lend this book to me to read.  I am sorry Manish it took this long and I have not met you next time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Lot of friends seem to enjoyed this one. Indeed it was.  Gowri is having this, shall check with zulfi and pass on to him a copy if he has not one already.</p>

<p>RMS: Your last question embodies the assumption that innovation is what we want and freedom is secondary. I think it's just the opposite: freedom is most important, and innovation is nice as long as we maintain our freedom.<br><br> Read this <b>excellent</b> interview <a href="http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2004/12/22/rms_interview.html">here.</a></p>

<p>What Linux myths or misconceptions do you find particularly galling?<br><br><br>I don't get upset that easily, so I can't say that there is any in <br>particular that I find galling. One myth that I find interesting, but <br>which has nothing to do with Linux or even the IT sector in particular, <br>is the myth of how a single person or even a single company makes a huge <br>difference in the market. It's the belief that things happen because <br>somebody was visionary and "planned" it that way. Sometimes the people <br>themselves seem to believe it, and then the myth becomes hubris.<br><br>I have to continually try to explain to people that no, I don't <br>"control" what happens in Linux. It's about having an environment that <br>is conducive to development, not so much about any particular leader. <br>And I think that is true in most cases, be it the "great sport coach" or <br>the "great spiritual leader."<br></p>

<i>Ignore Poor Spelling and Grammer, if you are about to read this </i>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Had pushed a lot of extra work for the weekends, but everything vaporized :)</p>
<p><br>yeah, ofcourse glanced through some, like the patent application from Ed, quick go through of the 1855MC presentation which I have to give on tuesday.</p>
<p><br>Missed going through rpm docs, test case revisions (some 22 comments are there), some office work completion.</p>
<p><br>Went to office on Saturday for  a brief period, could regress one issue which demanded quite a lot of setup time but then started playing around with a favorite game of mine:Blade of Darkness.  I remember, I used to play this a lot when at home, my sisters too enjoy it.  The codemasters, the company which develops the game has a tag "Genius at Play ". :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Now friends, thinking about calling Gowri and Susila; missed again.I have put the SIM in my mobile. Probably first thing tommorow should be this work.</p>
<p><br>Got two VCDs, Anbe Sivam and I,ROBOT.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Anbe Sivam was interesting. I liked the intial jokes between Kamal and Madhavan a lot.  Like... Madhavan is frantic for making a call and is already disgusted with Kamal who speaks a lot and interupts him again and again. Madhavan has burst his Cell phone by plugging in a wet Cell and talks to the receptionist of the hotel for making a call.</p>
<p><br>Madhavan: Can I make a STD Call?</p>
<p><br>Other end: No Sir,</p>
<p><br>M:Trunk Call?</p>
<p><br>O: No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Fax?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Email?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Courier?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Post Man?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>Kamal Interrupts: Pura ( Pegion).</p>
<p><br>Madhavan: Pura?</p>
<p><br>Madhavan turns;looks at Kamal, wondering!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>These are funny things, but film as a whole has lot scenes which have very deep meaning. While thinking about this later, I thought kamal should have given his role to someone else; the story would have come forth more to the audience.</p>
<p><br>I am by no means denying Kamals role; but thought that putting the flim and the meaning about everything else. Kamal, we see as an accomplished actor and this was yet another good piece. But, how would it have been if Nalla Sivam was some other actor with A.Arasu?  Hard to Imagine, right?  No, I am justing trying  the ways in which the movie's meaning should have come forth more prominently.</p>
<p><br>---</p>
<p><br>Well, well well. Saturday then, a bit of Uthcode and Sunday's morning till afternoon was on the same. I am glad that I have completed the Chapter 5 of K&amp;R. Recursive Decent Parser Problem's had me gasping for a long time. Now, just gone past it.Revisions on it will probably make more confortable with it.</p>
<p><br>Called Giri for a freakout and guy was already roaming with other friends when I called in. Slept a little at home and was thinking, If I dont enjoy today ( go out today) then it will be a tough week ahead! So called Parthi. We had planned to go to Giri's home this Sunday. but missed (as usual). So, we dropped in at MG, went to Shark Tales! had a pop corn, a burger, 2 coffee's in between. After the movie, went to Amoeba: tried Dance Dance Revolution each,watched the bowling there for some time. Food world and coffee again, this time at Barista :). Spent talking a while and it was 10 already.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Returned home and scribbling this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hey, someone reading till this line:Read the book "five point someone". It is very interesting!!, spent some time on it as well :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>(Hope this blog answers to all(mom,aunt.sis'ers,friends),who might be thinking what the hell I was doing without giving a call)</p>

<p>Well, it should have not taken so long to read it full. But had got that book when I was not in touch with reading books.</p>
<p><br>Had met Manish at one of our BLUG meets and he had that book, I kindda wondered what this new book was and was looking through it. Just expected not another kind of  "<span style="font-style:italic;">Count your eggs before they chicken</span>" kindda crap. I have not read those, but really dont like to. Dont know why. Perhaps try to read them some time :)</p>
<p><br>But Manish's review was, if you have enjoyed Dil Chata Hai, you might like this as well and he offered to lend this book to me to read.  I am sorry Manish it took this long and I have not met you next time.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Lot of friends seem to enjoyed this one. Indeed it was.  Gowri is having this, shall check with zulfi and pass on to him a copy if he has not one already.</p>

<p>What Linux myths or misconceptions do you find particularly galling?<br><br><br>I don't get upset that easily, so I can't say that there is any in <br>particular that I find galling. One myth that I find interesting, but <br>which has nothing to do with Linux or even the IT sector in particular, <br>is the myth of how a single person or even a single company makes a huge <br>difference in the market. It's the belief that things happen because <br>somebody was visionary and "planned" it that way. Sometimes the people <br>themselves seem to believe it, and then the myth becomes hubris.<br><br>I have to continually try to explain to people that no, I don't <br>"control" what happens in Linux. It's about having an environment that <br>is conducive to development, not so much about any particular leader. <br>And I think that is true in most cases, be it the "great sport coach" or <br>the "great spiritual leader."<br></p>

<i>Ignore Poor Spelling and Grammer, if you are about to read this </i>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Had pushed a lot of extra work for the weekends, but everything vaporized :)</p>
<p><br>yeah, ofcourse glanced through some, like the patent application from Ed, quick go through of the 1855MC presentation which I have to give on tuesday.</p>
<p><br>Missed going through rpm docs, test case revisions (some 22 comments are there), some office work completion.</p>
<p><br>Went to office on Saturday for  a brief period, could regress one issue which demanded quite a lot of setup time but then started playing around with a favorite game of mine:Blade of Darkness.  I remember, I used to play this a lot when at home, my sisters too enjoy it.  The codemasters, the company which develops the game has a tag "Genius at Play ". :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Now friends, thinking about calling Gowri and Susila; missed again.I have put the SIM in my mobile. Probably first thing tommorow should be this work.</p>
<p><br>Got two VCDs, Anbe Sivam and I,ROBOT.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Anbe Sivam was interesting. I liked the intial jokes between Kamal and Madhavan a lot.  Like... Madhavan is frantic for making a call and is already disgusted with Kamal who speaks a lot and interupts him again and again. Madhavan has burst his Cell phone by plugging in a wet Cell and talks to the receptionist of the hotel for making a call.</p>
<p><br>Madhavan: Can I make a STD Call?</p>
<p><br>Other end: No Sir,</p>
<p><br>M:Trunk Call?</p>
<p><br>O: No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Fax?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Email?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Courier?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>M:Post Man?</p>
<p><br>O:No,Sir.</p>
<p><br>Kamal Interrupts: Pura ( Pegion).</p>
<p><br>Madhavan: Pura?</p>
<p><br>Madhavan turns;looks at Kamal, wondering!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>These are funny things, but film as a whole has lot scenes which have very deep meaning. While thinking about this later, I thought kamal should have given his role to someone else; the story would have come forth more to the audience.</p>
<p><br>I am by no means denying Kamals role; but thought that putting the flim and the meaning about everything else. Kamal, we see as an accomplished actor and this was yet another good piece. But, how would it have been if Nalla Sivam was some other actor with A.Arasu?  Hard to Imagine, right?  No, I am justing trying  the ways in which the movie's meaning should have come forth more prominently.</p>
<p><br>---</p>
<p><br>Well, well well. Saturday then, a bit of Uthcode and Sunday's morning till afternoon was on the same. I am glad that I have completed the Chapter 5 of K&amp;R. Recursive Decent Parser Problem's had me gasping for a long time. Now, just gone past it.Revisions on it will probably make more confortable with it.</p>
<p><br>Called Giri for a freakout and guy was already roaming with other friends when I called in. Slept a little at home and was thinking, If I dont enjoy today ( go out today) then it will be a tough week ahead! So called Parthi. We had planned to go to Giri's home this Sunday. but missed (as usual). So, we dropped in at MG, went to Shark Tales! had a pop corn, a burger, 2 coffee's in between. After the movie, went to Amoeba: tried Dance Dance Revolution each,watched the bowling there for some time. Food world and coffee again, this time at Barista :). Spent talking a while and it was 10 already.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Returned home and scribbling this.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hey, someone reading till this line:Read the book "five point someone". It is very interesting!!, spent some time on it as well :)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>(Hope this blog answers to all(mom,aunt.sis'ers,friends),who might be thinking what the hell I was doing without giving a call)</p>

<p>Nice see my first article in the Dell PowerSolutions Journal.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br><a href="http://www.dell.com/downloads/global/power/ps4q04-20040115-Kumaran.pdf">Using Log Messages and alert actions in Dell OpenManage Server Administrator</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Its not very technical, can be read and understood with ease.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hope it is helpful to the system administrators using OpenManage and invokes some curiosity in others.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Hope you enjoy reading it!</p>

<p>Nobody should start to undertake a large project. You start with a small<br><em>trivial</em> project, and you should never expect it to get large. If you<br>do, you'll just overdesign and generally think it is more important than<br>it likely is at that stage. Or worse, you might be scared away by the<br>sheer size of the work you envision. <br><br>So start small, and think about the details. Don't think about some big<br>picture and fancy design. If it doesn't solve some fairly immediate<br>need, it's almost certainly over-designed. And don't expect people to<br>jump in and help you. That's not how these things work. You need to get<br>something half-way <em>useful</em> first, and then others will say "hey, that<br><em>almost</em> works for me", and they'll get involved in the project. <br><br>And if there is anything I've learnt from Linux, it's that projects have<br>a life of their own, and you should <em>not</em> try to enforce your "vision"<br>too strongly on them. Most often you're wrong anyway, and if you're not<br>flexible and willing to take input from others (and willing to change<br>direction when it turned out your vision was flawed), you'll never get<br>anything good done. <br><br>In other words, be willing to admit your mistakes, and don't expect to<br>get anywhere big in any kind of short timeframe. I've been doing Linux<br>for thirteen years, and I expect to do it for quite some time still. If<br>I had <em>expected</em> to do something that big, I'd never have started. It<br>started out small and insignificant, and that's how I thought about it.<br><br>- Linus Benedict Torvalds<br><br><br><br></p>

<p>Linus has written a nice article at lwn. It is interesting to read and its about Management. Its titled Linus on kernel management and deals with management in genral. </p>
<p><br>He oftens says,(I have read him saying) that he is more of a manager for the kernel now rather than core developer.</p>

<p><br><span style="font-style:italic;">First off, I'd suggest buying "Seven Habits of Highly Successful</span></p>
<p><br>People", and NOT read it.  Burn it, it's a great symbolic gesture. </p>

<p><br>(*) This document does so not so much by answering the question, but by</p>
<p><br>making it painfully obvious to the questioner that we don't have a clue</p>

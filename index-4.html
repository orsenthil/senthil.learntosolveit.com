The black background symbolizes this darkness, pollution, smoke and all the bad elements arising out of man's creation.<br><br>With growing temperature, rising global warming, ozone layer depletion, and the earth is becoming a ball of fire. The varying shades of yellow, orange and red in concentric circles depict the exponential growth of the intensity of fire with time.<br><br>To prevent his cherished creation going in perils, God comes to rescue. This super human power extends his hand to help mankind. His touch creates a spark, giving rise to a strong thought of a new green revolution on earth. Man needs to be aware of this to bring back the old greener earth where he lived. As this small thought gets created on each human mind, the beautiful twigs sprout into tender green leaves.<br><br>Let this GENESIS of thought for a "green revolution" be deep rooted in the human mind.<br><br><span style="font-style:italic;">- Collage by Praveen,Aarthi,Raj and Senthil prepared for the Environment day.</span>

<p>Ode to a School Computer</p>
<p>By David Ahl</p>
<p>I was stay'in after school a week or so ago</p>
<p>'Cause I told a teacher where she could go</p>
<p>She had me settin' in this big old room</p>
<p>With a bunch of machines that just looked like doom</p>
<p>There's this big Mutha machine with flashing' lights</p>
<p>And a couple of funny-looking' electric typewrites</p>
<p>Well I thought I'd type somethin' for the fun of it</p>
<p>So I hunted and pecked out just one word - "shit"</p>
<p>Before I could lean back in my chair and get steady</p>
<p>That machine typed WHAT, and then it said READY</p>
<p>So I typed a whole line of them four-letter words</p>
<p>But it just replied WHAT and READY like it hadn't heard</p>
<p>Well I figured since I couldn't go out fishin'</p>
<p>I'd teach that stupid machine to listen</p>
<p>So I picked up this book called Teach yourself BASIC</p>
<p>And sat down at that Teletype prepared to face it</p>
<p>First I found to make that machine type my bit</p>
<p>I just had to put a PRINT in front of it</p>
<p>And then I found out that thing could add</p>
<p>And subtract and multiply and divide like mad</p>
<p>I found out too it knew all kinds of games</p>
<p>Like craps and blackjack and a cannon to aim</p>
<p>I was havin' all kinds of fun when that teacher walked in</p>
<p>She just looked at my output and started to grin</p>
<p>I kind of sheepishly asked  if I could stay a while more</p>
<p>She said: "Sure; when you just shut the door".</p>
<p>I tried some more games like football and poker</p>
<p>And a parachute jump written by some kind of joker</p>
<p>There was one where I could try to land on the moon</p>
<p>It would crash and blow up if fired the engines too soon</p>
<p>Well, I played on through supper and into the night</p>
<p>And then finally quit when I saw dawn's first light.</p>
<p>Some girls, I know are while lot cuter</p>
<p>But  I found a new kind of high with that computer.</p>

<p><br>Had stumbled across a detailed information on this incident on <a href="http://usr.blogspot.com/2004/12/bhopal-disaster.html">Dec 3 2004</a>, when I decided that I should be reading this book.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Begins with the story of Ratan Nadar, a typical Advasi Indian peasant and the story follows his and his family's destiny. Without any kind of rhetoric nature, the story goes in a detailed manner presenting most of the information objectively. Ratan Nadar's children aged 5,6 and 8 going to work a match factory and handling toxic chemical which onces catches fire and padmini, the eldest discovers her brother dead.</p>
<p><br>Ratan like many others continuosly faces hardships in his village. He moves to Bhopal,a big city,gets a job as a worker constructing the Bhopal Railway station.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Union Carbide discovers sevin pesticide,which can improve the crop productivity. Plans to establish a factory in India, Bhopal. The chief architect Eduardo Munoz doubts the need for UC like factory in India, feeling the nature of India and its problems, but UC's board of directors get better of him.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The motives are profit! But story reveals several earnest people establishing and working at the UC Plant in India and how Union Carbide is a dream company.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>Things take a turn.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br>The book is about the people living at Oriya Bustee, Kali Ghats, their custom and their work and their relationship with UC. How things change. How people help each other when the real need arises. How people are indifferent to each other. How can some indifferent attitudes prove too costly.</p>

<p><br><b>The Right to Read</b>  by <a href="http://www.stallman.org">rms</a></p>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<p> <em>This article appeared in the February 1997 issue of <strong>Communications of the ACM</strong> (Volume 40, Number 2).</em></p>   <blockquote><p>         (from "The Road To Tycho", a collection of articles          about the antecedents of the Lunarian Revolution,           published in Luna City in 2096) </p></blockquote>   <p> For Dan Halbert, the road to Tycho began in college--when Lissa Lenz asked to borrow his computer.  Hers had broken down, and unless she could borrow another, she would fail her midterm project.  There was no one she dared ask, except Dan.</p>   <p> This put Dan in a dilemma.  He had to help her--but if he lent her his computer, she might read his books.  Aside from the fact that you could go to prison for many years for letting someone else read your books, the very idea shocked him at first.  Like everyone, he had been taught since elementary school that sharing books was nasty and wrong--something that only pirates would do.</p>   <p> And there wasn't much chance that the SPA--the Software Protection Authority--would fail to catch him.  In his software class, Dan had learned that each book had a copyright monitor that reported when and where it was read, and by whom, to Central Licensing.  (They used this information to catch reading pirates, but also to sell personal interest profiles to retailers.)  The next time his computer was networked, Central Licensing would find out.  He, as computer owner, would receive the harshest punishment--for not taking pains to prevent the crime.</p>   <p> Of course, Lissa did not necessarily intend to read his books.  She might want the computer only to write her midterm.  But Dan knew she came from a middle-class family and could hardly afford the tuition, let alone her reading fees.  Reading his books might be the only way she could graduate.  He understood this situation; he himself had had to borrow to pay for all the research papers he read.  (10% of those fees went to the researchers who wrote the papers; since Dan aimed for an academic career, he could hope that his own research papers, if frequently referenced, would bring in enough to repay this loan.)</p>   <p> Later on, Dan would learn there was a time when anyone could go to the library and read journal articles, and even books, without having to pay.  There were independent scholars who read thousands of pages without government library grants.  But in the 1990s, both commercial and nonprofit journal publishers had begun charging fees for access. By 2047, libraries offering free public access to scholarly literature were a dim memory.</p>   <p> There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central Licensing.  They were themselves illegal.  Dan had had a classmate in software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool, and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading books.  But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were easily tempted into betrayal).  In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.</p>   <p> Dan would later learn that there was a time when anyone could have debugging tools.  There were even free debugging tools available on CD or downloadable over the net.  But ordinary users started using them to bypass copyright monitors, and eventually a judge ruled that this had become their principal use in actual practice.  This meant they were illegal; the debuggers' developers were sent to prison.</p>   <p> Programmers still needed debugging tools, of course, but debugger vendors in 2047 distributed numbered copies only, and only to officially licensed and bonded programmers.  The debugger Dan used in software class was kept behind a special firewall so that it could be used only for class exercises.</p>   <p> It was also possible to bypass the copyright monitors by installing a modified system kernel.  Dan would eventually find out about the free kernels, even entire free operating systems, that had existed around the turn of the century.  But not only were they illegal, like debuggers--you could not install one if you had one, without knowing your computer's root password.  And neither the FBI nor Microsoft Support would tell you that.</p>   <p> Dan concluded that he couldn't simply lend Lissa his computer.  But he couldn't refuse to help her, because he loved her.  Every chance to speak with her filled him with delight.  And that she chose him to ask for help, that could mean she loved him too.</p>   <p> Dan resolved the dilemma by doing something even more unthinkable--he lent her the computer, and told her his password.  This way, if Lissa read his books, Central Licensing would think he was reading them.  It was still a crime, but the SPA would not automatically find out about it.  They would only find out if Lissa reported him.</p>   <p> Of course, if the school ever found out that he had given Lissa his own password, it would be curtains for both of them as students, regardless of what she had used it for.  School policy was that any interference with their means of monitoring students' computer use was grounds for disciplinary action.  It didn't matter whether you did anything harmful--the offense was making it hard for the administrators to check on you.  They assumed this meant you were doing something else forbidden, and they did not need to know what it was.</p>   <p> Students were not usually expelled for this--not directly.  Instead they were banned from the school computer systems, and would inevitably fail all their classes.</p>   <p> Later, Dan would learn that this kind of university policy started only in the 1980s, when university students in large numbers began using computers.  Previously, universities maintained a different approach to student discipline; they punished activities that were harmful, not those that merely raised suspicion.</p>   <p> Lissa did not report Dan to the SPA.  His decision to help her led to their marriage, and also led them to question what they had been taught about piracy as children.  The couple began reading about the history of copyright, about the Soviet Union and its restrictions on copying, and even the original United States Constitution.  They moved to Luna, where they found others who had likewise gravitated away from the long arm of the SPA.  When the Tycho Uprising began in 2062, the universal right to read soon became one of its central aims.</p> <p></p>
